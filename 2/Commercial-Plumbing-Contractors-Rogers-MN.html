Some homeowners will attempt to remove the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These solutions do work, specifically if you are dealing with a small drain clog. However, they are generally temporary repairs that do not offer irreversible resolutions.</p>
