<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and then return to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not.

If you have a changing water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
