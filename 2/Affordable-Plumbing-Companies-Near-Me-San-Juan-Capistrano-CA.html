Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
