<p>Strong sewage smell in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage odor originating from your bathroom or another area of your house can be a sign of a serious issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your home may have burst or otherwise broken. It is very important that you call a certified plumber if there is a persistent sewage smell in your house. Raw sewage is very dangerous and can present major health threats.</p>
<p>Water supplied by the public utility contains some amounts of harmful chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems eliminate these pollutants to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are important requirements, not optional expenditures. A house plumbing inspection will either be visual, made with a camera, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>There's a great chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This corrosion can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have many unfavorable results on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing property owners wish to get their hands unclean with. It needs more than just effort to fix broken sewer systems, and the difficulty is frequently due to how frustrating it is to examine the damage. This is much more bothersome if the damage is permanent or needs more substantial repair work, especially in commercial settings.</p>
