<p>As soon as the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical locations in the assembly.

<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
