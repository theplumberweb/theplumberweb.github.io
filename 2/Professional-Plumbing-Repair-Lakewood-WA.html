<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than items containing extreme chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
