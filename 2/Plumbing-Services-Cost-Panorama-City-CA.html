It truly isn't a good idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have been specifically developed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or will not disperse your weight uniformly and might eventually trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
