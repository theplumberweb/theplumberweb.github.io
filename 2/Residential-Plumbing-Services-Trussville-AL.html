<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet in Trussville AL 35173</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
