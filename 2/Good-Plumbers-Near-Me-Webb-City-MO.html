<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water system line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.

Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the primary water system system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
