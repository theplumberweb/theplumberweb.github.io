It is essential to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively working RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas subject to water damage. Adequate drainage should also be offered.</p>
