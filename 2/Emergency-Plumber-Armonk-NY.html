<p>How to replace a garbage or install disposal. Sewer lines can fail for a variety of reasons, including bad soil conditions, blockages from grease and gunk, and corrosion. Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, specifically in older neighborhoods where clay pipe may have been used. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly intensified if pipes have actually been allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers enhances water's taste, however its high cost makes it not practical as a household solution. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, however render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, in many cases, contain phosphates that damage the environment.
