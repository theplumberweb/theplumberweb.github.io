The pipe lining procedure includes our team saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is totally filled. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and fractures. The liner is left to harden in place for a number of hours or 60 minutes if heat is used. When the process is complete, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be checked one more time to ensure your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>

The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
