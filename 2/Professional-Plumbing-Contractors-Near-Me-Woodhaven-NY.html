<p>Our commercial plumbers are focused on contributing to the health, security and convenience of customers and their customers throughout the Illinois and Wisconsin region.

<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has altered color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>
<p>There's a good opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This deterioration can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>

We ensure the work is done appropriately every time. Most of our customers are in Montgomery County, although we make toilet repairs in Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia, too.
