<h3>Water Heater Repair Procedures at Monroe MI 48162</h3>
<p>Backpressure may take place when the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or component which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. Drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not effectively safeguarded.</p>
<p>While combating a fire, firefighters are understandably more concerned about drawing enough water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any available source to accomplish their objective, but fire department lorries typically bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main drains traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
