<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
