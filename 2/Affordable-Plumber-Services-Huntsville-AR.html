Where the company is located: Beware of contractors who provide you a post office box without any street address or use only an answering service.

Correct safety preventative measures must be followed for appropriate entry if the area is considered a confined space.

If the backflow preventer is set up in a limiting area, this might affect the professional's ability to effectively complete the repair.</p>
