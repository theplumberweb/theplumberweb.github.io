<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
