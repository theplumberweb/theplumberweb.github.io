<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will develop. Sometimes the option is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is necessary to resolve the problem. Other times a more extensive service is required: repiping.</p>

The heating temperature is normally pre-set to match your requirements and preferences. Since they just heat water when required, tankless electric water heaters use less power than conventional water heaters.</p>
