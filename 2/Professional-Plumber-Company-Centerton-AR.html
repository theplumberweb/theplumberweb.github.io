<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to prevent backflow. The basic means of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
