All plumbing should have their tests on at the time of inspection or the plumber need to license the plumbing was evaluated on the test form on the ideal side of this page.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
