<h3>Drain Pipe Repair in Plymouth New Hampshire</h2>
<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner set and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
