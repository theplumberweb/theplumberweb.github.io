Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
