<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
