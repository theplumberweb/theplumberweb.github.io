<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it also.</p>
