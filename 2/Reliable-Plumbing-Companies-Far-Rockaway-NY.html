<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

<p>Surface Accelerated Crystallization is an innovation that imitates biomineralization, the system frequently recognized for structured growth in the environment, consisting of seashells. Water softening is accomplished with SACr by using exclusive polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads accelerate the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely remove short-term firmness in water.</p>
