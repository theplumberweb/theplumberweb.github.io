If the part is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
