There are a few food products you should most likely not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
