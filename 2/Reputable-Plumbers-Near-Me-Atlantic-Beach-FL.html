<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Atlantic Beach FL</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
