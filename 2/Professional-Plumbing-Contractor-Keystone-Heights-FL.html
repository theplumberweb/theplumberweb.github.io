<p>An unusual gurgling sound when your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never a good sign. Don't depend on a plunger to fix the issue-- depend on your plumber for sewer line repair. As we have stated before backflow prevention gadgets and assemblies reduce pressure and volume readily available to the life safety and property protection systems.  Most fire sprinkler heads, except sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Usually, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Regardless of the operating system, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>

<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Keystone Heights FL</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
