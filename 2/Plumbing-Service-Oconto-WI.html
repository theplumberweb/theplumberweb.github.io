<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
