<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert television back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too brief. To prevent this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation set includes a tube, or purchase one independently at the same time for about $3.</p>
