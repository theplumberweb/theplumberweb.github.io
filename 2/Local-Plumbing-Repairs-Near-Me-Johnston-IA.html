<h3>Shower Repairs in Johnston IA 50131 - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less vital things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
