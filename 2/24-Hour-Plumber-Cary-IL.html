<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
