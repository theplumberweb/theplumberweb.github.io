<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would typically cause rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately become worn and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your water heater very rapidly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
