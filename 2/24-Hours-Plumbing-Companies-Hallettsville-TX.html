<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
