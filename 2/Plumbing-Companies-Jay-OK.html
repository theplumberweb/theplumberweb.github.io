<h3>Basic Plumber Tools For Any Job Jay OK</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had great reviews and a fair cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it also.</p>
