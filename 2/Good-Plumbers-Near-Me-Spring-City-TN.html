Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
