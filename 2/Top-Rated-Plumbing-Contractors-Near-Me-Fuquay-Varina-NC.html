If you discover rusty water, rumbling or banging sounds originating from your water heater's tank, an increased quantity of time required to heat your water, or puddles of water under your hot water heater, it's time to call the specialists about repair or replacement options.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification.
