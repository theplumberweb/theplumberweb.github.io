<p>Typically caused by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and inspect if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is usually the fix. Additionally, in some cases a faulty fill valve may actuate intermittently, as well. Water won't drain or is draining slowly through the disposal.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
