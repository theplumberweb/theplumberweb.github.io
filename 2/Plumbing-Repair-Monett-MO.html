<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Monett MO 65708</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
