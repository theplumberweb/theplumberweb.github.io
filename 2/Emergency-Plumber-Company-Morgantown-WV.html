<p>Backpressure might happen when the potable supply piping is connected to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks.

<p>This might seem like a joke, but it's extremely major if you want to truly get the most out of your investment. Start by requesting for a copy of the plumbing inspection list.
