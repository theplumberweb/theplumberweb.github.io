<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there must be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food products you need to most likely not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
