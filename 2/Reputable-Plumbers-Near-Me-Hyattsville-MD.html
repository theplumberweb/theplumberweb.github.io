<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

Preventive cleaning for drains should be performed on all drains, including toilet, sink, tub and floor drains.</p>
