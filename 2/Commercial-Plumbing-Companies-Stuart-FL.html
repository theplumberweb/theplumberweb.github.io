<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A number of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable precautions.</p>
