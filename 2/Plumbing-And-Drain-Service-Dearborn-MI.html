Homes built in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, individuals had no concept that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, not to mention the health risks associated with lead.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>If your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering a stoppage, with PVC you have a couple of options. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. If the line has to do with 40 years of ages and is revealing signs of age throughout, absolutely replace. Nowadays, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it might be an appropriate option to do simply that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be an option.</p>
