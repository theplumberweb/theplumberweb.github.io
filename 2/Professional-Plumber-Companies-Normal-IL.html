<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, utilize the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will suit the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Several homes in my area being repiped and have actually spoken with neighbors about the problems leading up to this.
