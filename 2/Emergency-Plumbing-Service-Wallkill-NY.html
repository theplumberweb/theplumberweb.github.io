<p>The correct repair of a backflow preventer needs lots of products to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly should be assessed. The installation must be evaluated to guarantee it does not circumvent the functions of the assembly. Test data must be collected to figure out the functions of each element. The backflow prevention assembly should be taken apart and parts replaced with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be tested once again to be sure it was properly repaired. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the makers flow chart is required to ensure it was repaired effectively. A properly repaired assembly should offer years of defense.</p>
