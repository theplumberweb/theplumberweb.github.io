<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly.
