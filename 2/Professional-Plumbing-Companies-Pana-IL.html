<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Pana IL 62557</h3>
<p>When the drinkable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Non-potable and potable water or liquids can be required into the potable supply system if these connections are not correctly secured.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than building up on surfaces. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the buildup might still occur.</p>
