Some toilets, however, have uniquely shaped bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It really isn't a great concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have been particularly developed to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or won't distribute your weight evenly and might ultimately cause fractures in the bowl.</p>
