<p>When making a selection, ask for proof of a license. Many states require plumbers to be licensed, and they generally provide a number you can contact us to verify that the license is existing and that there are no active problems against it. Any plumber you think about must also hold a current employees' compensation policy and a minimum of $500,000 liability insurance.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains obstructing, this might be a sign of a bigger issue, like a tree root invasion or a big clog.

Little clogs can develop into huge ones fairly quickly.</p>

<p>Gently lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted effectively (Picture 8). You don't have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>While pipe lining is a terrific alternative for most people, there are some circumstances where repiping is the only option. Repiping is the process of replacing old rusty pipes with long-lasting and durable new pipes. Because of their durability and other aspects, the brand-new pipes that are utilized are generally made of copper. Repiping is primarily done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and constructed of galvanized metals.</p>
