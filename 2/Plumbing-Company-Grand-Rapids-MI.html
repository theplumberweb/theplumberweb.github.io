<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing installed throughout building and construction of a brand-new or renovated building is set up by knowledgeable craftsmen in accordance with applicable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the meals, or put flat soda in your sink, you typically know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.

Blockages in a component can cause destructive damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
