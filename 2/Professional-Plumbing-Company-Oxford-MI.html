<p>Water temperature level problems can be fixed by changing the temperature on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can simply unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the method, water pressure can also be low.</p>
