Well, we still suggest you have a backflow preventer installed anywhere incoming water and wastewater might be cross-connected.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
