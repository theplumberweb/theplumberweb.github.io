<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>Prior to our professional service technicians can start applying their abilities and experience, we first need to guarantee that the line is properly cleaned up and gotten ready for our repair. Our repair procedures count on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections caused by waste accumulation can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for an extensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and offer a careful cleaning.</p>
