<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially meant for the disposer discharge elbow.

The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to incorrect drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>Next, slip on the installing ring and snap ring. Tighten up the 3 mounting screws, alternately tightening each screw a few turns at a time up until the mounting assembly is evenly and firmly seated versus the bottom of the sink.
