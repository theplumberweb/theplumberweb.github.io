<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
