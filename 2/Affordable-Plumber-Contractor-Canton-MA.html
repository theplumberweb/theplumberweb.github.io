<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
