<p>You might be tempted to bond or patch a leak shut or replace just a single section of pipe to conserve cash. While this might work in the short term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the very same material as other pipes in your house, implying that difficulty could be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you peace of mind and avoid bigger leaks down the roadway.</p>

And these distinctions dictate the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>
