<p>As soon as the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company supplies include double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel designs), and decreased pressure zone assemblies. Suggestion: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, remove the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet prior to mounting the disposal. Also connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you attach the P-trap.</p>
