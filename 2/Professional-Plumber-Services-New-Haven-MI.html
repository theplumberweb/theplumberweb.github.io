<p>First consider your choices if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually started to leak. A full sewer pipe replacement might not be needed. Often, relining your existing pipes is a better choice. If your sewer lines are underneath trees, near extensive landscaping, pathways, driveways or other semi-permanent features, total sewer excavation can trigger a great deal of collateral damage (and expense) to the surrounding area.</p>

When you have a problem with your sewer line, you need a professional inspection to precisely identify the problem.
