<p>The most efficient way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Use of tankless systems in 2nd homes gets rid of risks of water damage.
