This guarantees that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other irrigation and wastewater systems stays disconnected from clean" water.</p>

<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow of water which may bring unclean water or other, hazardous compounds into the general public water system and private plumbing. Backflow can take place in a number of situations that might draw water from locations such as garden fountains, pool, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water supply lines. Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
