<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the faulty pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer. However, to thwart off that threat, mercaptans are included into gas, which provides it a rotten egg smell and makes it noticeable when leaking. Make sure to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
