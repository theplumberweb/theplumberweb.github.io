<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Springboro OH</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for the majority of fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing entirely, backflow can happen.</p>
