<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Reduced to TAC, this method uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where solidity mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline type that will not cling to surface areas. These crystals are tiny and circulation generally through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need ongoing regrowth.</p>
