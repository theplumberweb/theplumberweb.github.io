Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the day-to-day expenditures and frustrations incurred by tough water, a water softener is ultimately an investment that will save you a considerable amount of cash. The cost of the water softener system is considerably outweighed by the cash and energy conserved.</p>

Furthermore, grease and oil can collect and harden in your drain too. After completing cooking, think about pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve.
