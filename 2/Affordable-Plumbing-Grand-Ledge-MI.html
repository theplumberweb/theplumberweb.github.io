Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
