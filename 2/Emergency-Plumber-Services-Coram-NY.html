<p>New models of garbage disposals may need to be hard-wired into a dedicated electrical circuit from the electrical panel; if this isn't offered in an older house, hiring an electrician to add a circuit expenses around $150-$ 250.

If you have actually been noticing a moldy odor developing in the cabinets under the sink, you may have a leak somewhere. It might be the drain, the faucet, or even the supply hose. Considering that they are fairly simple to determine, switch on the water and get sleuthing under your sink.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
