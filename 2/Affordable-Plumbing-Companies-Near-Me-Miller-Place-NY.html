<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a necessity more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close correctly.
