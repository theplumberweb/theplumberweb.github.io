Most of toilets are basic sized - suggesting a "will fit" seat suffices for security and convenience. Some toilets, nevertheless, have distinctively formed bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't a great concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have been specifically designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or will not disperse your weight equally and could ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
