<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide might limit the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
