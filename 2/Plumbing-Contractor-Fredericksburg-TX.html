<p>Due to the fact that it can spread out infected water back through a circulation system, Backflow is a prospective issue in a water system. For example, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any potential or actual connection in between the public water system and a source of contamination or pollution) can allow contaminants or pollutants to go into the potable water system. Illness can result from ingesting water that has been polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair specialist knows the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
