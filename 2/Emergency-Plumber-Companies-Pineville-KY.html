<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Pineville KY</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for the majority of fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can occur.</p>
