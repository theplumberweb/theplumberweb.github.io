Water pressure might stop working or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
