It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly operating RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water.

Sufficient drainage needs to likewise be supplied.</p>
<p>Your storm drains don't go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is typically channelled in other places to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, or even the ocean in.

<p>Once the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized.

The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>
