<p>Surface Accelerated Condensation is a creation that imitates biomineralization, the system commonly recognized for structured growth in the environment, including seashells. Water softening is accomplished with SACr by using exclusive polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads accelerate the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely get rid of temporary hardness in water.</p>
<p>Jams-- The disposal may end up being jammed with food or other products. We can clear jams and help consumers know what they need to not put down their disposals.
