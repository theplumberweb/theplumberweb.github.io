<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
