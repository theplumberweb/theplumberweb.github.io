<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
