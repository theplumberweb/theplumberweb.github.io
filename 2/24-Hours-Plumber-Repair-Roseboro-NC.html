While gas designs are less expensive to run, they do require an existing natural gas line. The price of an electrical hot water heater is usually lower, however it can be more expensive to run.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>If you are wanting to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually started to leak, very first consider your choices. A complete sewer pipe replacement may not be needed.
