<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to place television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might need to make a time-wasting journey to the shop. To prevent this, make sure the new garbage disposal installation set includes a tube, or purchase one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>
