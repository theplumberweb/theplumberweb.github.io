<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>

We'll examine the benefits and drawbacks of tankless and conventional units so you can make an informed choice. Tankless to Tankless Installation: This typically takes between one to three hours.</p>
