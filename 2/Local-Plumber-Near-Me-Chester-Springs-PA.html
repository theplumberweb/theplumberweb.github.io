<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than items including harsh chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the most part, a waste disposal unit is just geared up to deal with softer organic waste. It might trigger it to jam and not work effectively if bones or other tough foods get stuck in the disposal. By running hot water through the disposal, you might be able to clear the clog yourself. However you run the risk of harming the motor or blades.</p>
