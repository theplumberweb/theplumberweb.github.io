<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
