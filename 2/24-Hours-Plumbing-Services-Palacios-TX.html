For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
