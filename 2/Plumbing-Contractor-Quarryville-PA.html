As rust and minerals build up in time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health threat in your water.</p>
<p>It is essential that all aspects of your gas lines remain in great condition. The state of the pipe is important. As is the connection to your home appliance and equipment.
