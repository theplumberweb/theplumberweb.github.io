<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a brand-new burner set and the hot water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself.

Toilet leakages around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
