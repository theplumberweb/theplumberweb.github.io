Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
