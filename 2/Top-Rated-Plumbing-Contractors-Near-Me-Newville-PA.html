<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The service technician shut off the water supply and loosened the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to remove the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture.

<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair technician understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
