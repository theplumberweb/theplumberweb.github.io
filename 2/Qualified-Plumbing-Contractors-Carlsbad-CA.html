<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
