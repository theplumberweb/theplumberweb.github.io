<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct effect on your safety, convenience, convenience, and dependability than your plumbing system. The most typical drain problem we are called for is concerns with drainage, such as a sink or tub that is sluggish to drain. Usually, drainage problems are an indication that there is a clog or accumulation inside your drains which needs to be cleaned out. Our Santa Fe drain cleaning experts have all of the required training and tools to clear and check out your drains.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation. I've talked to a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
