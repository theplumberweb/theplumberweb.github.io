<p>It can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less easily when water is hard. Water softening can avoid these negative effects. Gas is a colorless, odor free fuel. As a safety precaution, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that offers natural gas a smell typically related to rotten eggs. If it takes place, this distinctive aroma permits you to smell a potential leak. If you suspect a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>Breathing in leaked gas in an indoor area, such as your home can result in an absence of oxygen in the air and cause hypoxia. That can, in turn, result in severe headache, fatigue, decreased vision, brief breaths, and even loss of consciousness.
