<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a feasible solution, especially when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
