<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible service, specifically when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
