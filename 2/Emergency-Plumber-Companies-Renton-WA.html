<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
