<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Service in Saugus</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Is your house 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary material used in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it generally catches rust after about 50 years and needs replacement. Much more modern-day pipes will not last forever, so watch on plumbing systems that could be reaching the end of their life-span.</p>
