<p>Repiping your house with Super Plumbers is fast, simple and cost effective. If your pipes are old and weakening, call 903-630-6153 and speak to one of our expert piping specialists about whole house repiping today. For the average house that doesn't have serious water problems, the Aquakinetic Series is designed with 2 tanks to provide you with soft, clean water. These systems are non-electric and are practically maintenance-free.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the perpetrator. However not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with too little slack can cause difficulty too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>If you observe low water pressure or discolored water, it normally symbolizes rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop in time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you may see lower water pressure. The staining takes place when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your water system, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can end up being a health risk in your water.</p>
<p>You need to spend at least $50 to get a high-quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a resilient finish and a reliable stopper system. The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can use, however screwing it in and out can be bothersome. The twist-and-drop design is a lot easier to use but needs periodic -ring replacement.</p>
