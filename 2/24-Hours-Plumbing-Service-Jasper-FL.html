<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.
