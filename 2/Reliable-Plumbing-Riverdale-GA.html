The reasons for this can vary from leaks, malfunctioning or faulty electrical circuitry, or a broken heating aspect or thermostat.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the degree of the rot.

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
