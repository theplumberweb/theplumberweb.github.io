Thomas & Galbraith Heating, Cooling & Plumbing provides repair and replacement services for water heaters in the Cincinnati, Ohio area, in addition to cities and towns in the surrounding city. If you discover rusty water, rumbling or banging noises originating from your water heater's tank, an increased quantity of time required to heat your water, or puddles of water under your hot water heater, it's time to call the experts about repair or replacement alternatives.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers enhances water's taste, but its steep cost makes it not practical as a household service. Packaged chemicals soften water in small batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothing, and, in many cases, consist of phosphates that harm the environment. A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>
