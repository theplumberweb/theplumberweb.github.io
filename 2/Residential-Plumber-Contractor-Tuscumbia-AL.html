<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great man. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet broad) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
