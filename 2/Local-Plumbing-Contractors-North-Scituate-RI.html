<p>Check Valve (DCV) - safe for use both inside and underground, DCVs are a bit more pricey but are also highly practical, as they can be installed horizontally or vertically. Video cameras work in locating buried septic tanks or inspecting the condition of buried pipes to figure out appropriate maintenance schedules or the level of necessary repairs. When the corrupt sales representative takes control of the camera, he might play a pre-taped inspection of a pipe in very bad condition and state it is your pipe.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical substance that functions as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the accumulation could still occur.</p>
<p>If owner chooses to keep well, it needs to satisfy the current code requirements and have a working pump and faucet. For further info, call the Well and Septic Division at (937) 225-4428.
