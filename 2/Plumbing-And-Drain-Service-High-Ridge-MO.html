<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic guy. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as promised. I will certainly use Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be greater.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Everybody who's installed a few disposals understands this error: Forgetting to remove the dishwasher knockout before hanging the system. Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been just recently utilized and you have actually replaced the flapper, the problem may be larger than it appears. The tank ultimately loses its capability to seal appropriately, developing waste and a higher water expense.</p>
