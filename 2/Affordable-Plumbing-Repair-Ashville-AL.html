<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>

These accessories include backflow prevention system attachments, backflow device enclosures, test kits, repair parts, and insulated pouches.
