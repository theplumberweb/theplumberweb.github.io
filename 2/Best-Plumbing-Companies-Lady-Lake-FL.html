<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a service of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than products containing severe chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or components.</p>

<p>Drawbacks to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
