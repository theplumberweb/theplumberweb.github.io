Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to provide years of protection. There are lots of regional conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.
