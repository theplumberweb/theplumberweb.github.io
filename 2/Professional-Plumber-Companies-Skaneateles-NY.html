<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
