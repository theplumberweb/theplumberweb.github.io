<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers South Park PA</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a fair cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
