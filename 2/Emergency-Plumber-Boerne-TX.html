<p>Whether a supply of water is labelled "soft" or "tough" depends on the existence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no unfavorable impacts and are, in fact, necessary everyday nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the revitalizing taste many individuals discover desirable.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
