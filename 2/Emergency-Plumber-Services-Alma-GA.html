<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
