<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes.

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin.

A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
