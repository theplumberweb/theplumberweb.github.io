<p>This service warranty certifies and represents all other warranties to the customer, whether expressed or implied. This warranty disclaims without restriction suggested warranties of merchantability or physical fitness for a specific function or treatment of certain water conditions. Whether you need to prepare food, clean your hands, soak in the shower or a hot bath, or merely mop the floor, both your household water heating system and the flow of gas contribute essential aspects to your household's level of day-to-day convenience and benefit.</p>

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
