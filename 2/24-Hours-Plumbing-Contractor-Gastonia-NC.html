<p>Very seldom does any structural damage take place as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is typically discovered prior to it causes any substantial damage. The water leak is typically the size of a pinhole. This small hole allows water to constantly leak out extremely slowly. With time it can result in a considerable build of water. Leaked water usually remains under the house and fills into the ground soil. This can potentially trigger a cavity if your house's foundation was not correctly compressed. This is an unusual event and in basic, there is little concern over structural damage as the outcome of a slab leak.</p>
<p>Underneath the sink, stack the fiber gasket, backup flange, and installing ring, and slide onto the underside of the flange. Install the breeze ring by pulling it open and snapping into place.

<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
