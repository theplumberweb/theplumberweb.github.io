<p>Keep in mind that repiping a house is a major plumbing repair, and you need to just employ a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the task is done right. The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg.

<p>Backflow is the unfavorable reversal of circulation in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always stream towards the point of least expensive pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to assist battle a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The need upstream could cause a reversal in circulation.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing License and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pressed forward into the residential or commercial property, enabling it to flow backwards into city water materials.</p>
