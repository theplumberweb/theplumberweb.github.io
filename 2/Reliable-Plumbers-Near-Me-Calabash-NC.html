<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
