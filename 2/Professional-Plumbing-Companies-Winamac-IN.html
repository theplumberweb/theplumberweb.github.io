<p>One common way for a house's water supply to be infected is if the watering water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the problem might spread out significantly. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in specific homes, it likewise avoids wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and polluting the public water system.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to obstructions with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. They harden to the piping walls if fats are put down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls too. Even tree roots can create major drain clogs by wrapping around pipes.

If this is what is happening to your home, you need your drain cleaned before it results in more damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
