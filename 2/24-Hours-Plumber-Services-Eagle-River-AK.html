<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an exceptionally pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>While combating a fire, firefighters are understandably more concerned about drawing sufficient water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they utilize water from any available source to accomplish their objective, but fire department automobiles typically bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, deterioration inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>

<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in a solution and is used to express the strength of the level of acidity of a solution. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating deterioration Carbon dioxide will possibly add to the formation of carbonic acid, therefore making the water more destructive. The presence of high levels of co2 tends to correlate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
