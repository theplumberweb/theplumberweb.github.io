<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
