Garbage disposals can weigh 15 lbs. or more. That's a lot of weight to all of a sudden capture with one hand while you're turning the lower mounting bracket with the other hand.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing property owners want to get their hands filthy with. It requires more than just elbow grease to fix broken sewer systems, and the problem is frequently due to how problematic it is to evaluate the damage. This is a lot more troublesome if the damage is irreversible or requires more comprehensive repair work, specifically in commercial settings.</p>
