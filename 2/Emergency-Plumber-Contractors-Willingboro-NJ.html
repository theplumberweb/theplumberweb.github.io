<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.

It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
