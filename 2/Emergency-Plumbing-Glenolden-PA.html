<p>As soon as the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital locations in the assembly.

<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes.

Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
