<p>If you are wanting to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually started to leak, first consider your options. A full sewer pipe replacement may not be necessary. Often, relining your existing pipes is a better option. If your sewer lines are beneath trees, near comprehensive landscaping, pathways, driveways or other semi-permanent features, overall sewer excavation can trigger a great deal of civilian casualties (and expenditure) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>If a cable has not yet been run to the junction box, you can make the connections within the new disposer any time beforehand, signing up with the cable to the wires in package right before or just after installing the disposer. Garbage disposals are quite easy to maintain. The most essential thing to remember is that they are truly food disposals. Products that would otherwise enter the garbage should not be put in your disposal. This consists of glass, plastic, metals (yes, silverware), paper, anything flammable, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
<p>Usually, the cost to replace a toilet varies between $ 122 and $228, with the majority of homeowners spending around $ 150 to $180.

A high-efficiency toilet with extra functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour.
