<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The professional shut off the water supply and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to remove the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture. The client helped our specialist in moving the toilet back into its appropriate place, and the technician tightened up the bolts prior to restoring the water supply and making sure that the toilet was appropriately flushing.</p>
