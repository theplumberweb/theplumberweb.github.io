If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the suitable safety measures.</p>
