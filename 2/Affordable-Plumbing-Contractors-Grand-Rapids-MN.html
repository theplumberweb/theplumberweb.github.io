<p>If you think your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it does not always require a repair of your whole system. A toilet's tank is made up of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear, they lead to tiny leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>
