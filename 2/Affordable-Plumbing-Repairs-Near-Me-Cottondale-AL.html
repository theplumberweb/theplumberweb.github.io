<p>The best method to handle high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities site is by installing a pressure reducing valve (PRV).

<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash market.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
