<p>A. If you have rust spots, utilizing phosphoric acid usually will help eliminate them. , if you would like to attempt the gentlest method maybe attempt utilizing some Coke on the rust initially.. No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola consists of a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the directions and safety warnings first!), if that does not do the trick. Naval Jelly is what we here at Â® use to get rid of rust stains and it's easily available at the majority of hardware stores.</p>
<p>Many softeners have actually a bypass constructed into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to supply some sort of maintenance to it and even while you're dealing with installing it.
