<p>A. If you have rust spots, utilizing phosphoric acid usually will help eliminate them. , if you would like to attempt the gentlest method maybe attempt utilizing some Coke on the rust initially.. No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola consists of a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the directions and safety warnings first!), if that does not do the trick. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust stains and it's easily available at the majority of hardware stores.</p>
<p>Many softeners have actually a bypass constructed into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to supply some sort of maintenance to it and even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to keep the system.</p>
