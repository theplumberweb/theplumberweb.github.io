<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Mount Pleasant TX 75455</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
