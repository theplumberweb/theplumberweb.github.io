<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the issue if this is the case.
