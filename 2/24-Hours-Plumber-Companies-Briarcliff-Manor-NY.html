Local plumber quoted rate of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ happy I inspected around. Under the sink, put a bucket or pan underneath the waste pipe, then use locking-jaw pliers or a pipe wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen up the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roofing vents or pull out a toilet. This is generally more labor-intensive and may need additional costs. Because the drain machine loses torque the even more you are away from the clog, this is likewise not as effective.
