<p>It can take several weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. Initially, plans for each device to be installed need to be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which might take up to three weeks or more to process and authorize. Rejected strategies need to be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another numerous weeks to the timeline.</p>
