<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. It was a challenging task due to the fact that of the age of the house and area of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working prior to they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
