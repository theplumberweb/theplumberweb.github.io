<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet in Hawkinsville GA 31036</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
