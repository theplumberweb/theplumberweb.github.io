<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
