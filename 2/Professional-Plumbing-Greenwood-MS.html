<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
