<p>You reside in an older home. There's a good opportunity that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to wear away and burst when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one if so. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>Do not use ground joint unions except straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each location where you will have a gas appliance must have a gas shutoff valve.

All gas piping installations need a permit and inspection.</p>
