<h3>Resolution And Prevention Of Burst Pipes Huntington Beach CA</h3>
<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it too.</p>
