Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to supply one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is installed.
