<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Contractor in Wayne</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc developed and constructed a smaller sized design that ran on the exact same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
