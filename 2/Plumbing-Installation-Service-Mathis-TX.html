<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both.
