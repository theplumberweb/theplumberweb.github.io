<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
