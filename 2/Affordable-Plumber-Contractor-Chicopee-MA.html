<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there ought to be no problem in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you should probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
