<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required.

The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
