<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly.
