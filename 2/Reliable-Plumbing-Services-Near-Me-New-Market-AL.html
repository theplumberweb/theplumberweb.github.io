Exemptions, which are granted in exceptionally uncommon cases where the structure is considered to not pose a danger to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
