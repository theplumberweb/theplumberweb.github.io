Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no way to supply one, then we examine to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>

<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in locations where the ambient temperature is maintained at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.
