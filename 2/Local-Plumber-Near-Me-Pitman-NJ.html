It actually isn't an excellent idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have been specifically designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or will not disperse your weight equally and might ultimately trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
