<p>In this circumstance, dirty water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon flow, taste, smell or color. A plumbing professional can identify whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other problems in your house's plumbing system. More complex problems with water temperature or pressure may require changing the water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
