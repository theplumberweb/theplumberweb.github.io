<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there need to be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you need to probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
