<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Norco CA</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>Our backflow preventer choice includes hose connection vacuum breakers, atmospheric vacuum breakers, dual check valves and vented double check valves. Each backflow preventer is tested for efficiency and performance prior to leaving our Cullman, Alabama factory. This dedication to quality has actually made us among the most relied on names in the industry.</p>
