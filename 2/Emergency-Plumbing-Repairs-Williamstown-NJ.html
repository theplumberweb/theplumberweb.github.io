<h3>Kitchen Faucet Repair in Williamstown New Jersey</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
