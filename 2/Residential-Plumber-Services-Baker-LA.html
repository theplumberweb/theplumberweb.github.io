<p>By itself, natural gas is colorless and odorless. Many energy companies add a sulfur compound to gas, which is where the rotten egg odor originates from.

<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank lacks salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
