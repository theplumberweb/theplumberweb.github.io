<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Duxbury MA 02332</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
