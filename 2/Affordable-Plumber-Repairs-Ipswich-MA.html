<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 factor our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a home is due to the fact that there is excessive hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are easy and quite low-cost to install, so there's no factor not to. When grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and prevents water flow, eventually triggering a backup. This included with other debris in your drain can trigger a significant backup.</p>
