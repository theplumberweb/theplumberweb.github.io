<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
