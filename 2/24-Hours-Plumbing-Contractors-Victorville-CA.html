<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for the majority of building and construction contractors (or their staff members). The secret to the innovation is being able to control both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, consequently getting rid of solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
