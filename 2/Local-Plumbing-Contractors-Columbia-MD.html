<p>Frequently triggered by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and check if you see coloring in the bowl. This suggests a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is typically the fix. Additionally, sometimes a malfunctioning fill valve may activate intermittently, as well. Water will not drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>

Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
