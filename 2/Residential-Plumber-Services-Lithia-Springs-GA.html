<p>Letters are sent to residential consumers with known backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis. Rotate the disposal unit to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that connect it. Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or momentary connection between a public water system or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water system or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a serious public health risk if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
