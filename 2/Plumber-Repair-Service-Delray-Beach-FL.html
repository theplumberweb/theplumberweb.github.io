<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your safety, convenience, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. The most typical drain issue we are required is issues with drainage, such as a sink or tub that is sluggish to drain. Generally, drainage problems are an indication that there is a clog or accumulation inside your drains which needs to be cleaned out. Our Santa Fe drain cleaning experts have all of the required training and tools to clear and examine out your drains.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this accreditation. I have actually contacted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
