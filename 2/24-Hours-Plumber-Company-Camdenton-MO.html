<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
