<p>Disadvantages to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
