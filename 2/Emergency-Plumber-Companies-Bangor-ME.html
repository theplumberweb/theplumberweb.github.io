<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals expect to see however hardly ever stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Try freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Your storm drains don't go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is usually channelled elsewhere to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, or perhaps the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat areas of pipe that can be vulnerable to clogging because there just isn't enough a high enough flow to flush out the debris.</p>
