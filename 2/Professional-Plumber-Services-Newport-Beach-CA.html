As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there ought to be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you should probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
