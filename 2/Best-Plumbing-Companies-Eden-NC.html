<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Eden NC</h3>
<p>The most effective method to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners typically have a lifespan of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are correctly preserved. Ensuring the brine tank never ever lacks salt will extend the unit's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also secure the unit. Iron will nasty the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners improve the regeneration cycle and aid relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
