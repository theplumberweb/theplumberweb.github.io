<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of preserving the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace solidity ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other. However, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange happen? There is another crucial element required to make the procedure work: a resin bed consisting of lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>CareSoft Elite ® is a state-of-the-art water softener, equipped with a high-performance resin that easily lowers the hardest of minerals. With a trademarked chlorine generator, our superior systems also provide an automated cleaning cycle.
