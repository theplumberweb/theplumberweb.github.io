Our certified licensed and insured plumbing contractors are experienced in managing everything from leaky faucets to sewer repair. Positive-Action Salt Water Valve - Snap-together building eliminates use of solvents that may contaminate water. Positive action assists avoid overfilling.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is generally the culprit. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with too little slack can trigger trouble too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
