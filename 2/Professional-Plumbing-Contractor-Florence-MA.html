<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Florence MA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly unusual cases where the structure is considered to not present a risk to the water system, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
