<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
