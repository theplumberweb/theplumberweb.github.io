<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair broken pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them.

Once the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads.
