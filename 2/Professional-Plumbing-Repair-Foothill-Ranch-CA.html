<p>If your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing a stoppage, with PVC you have a couple of choices. The other is to go on and replace the whole line. If the line is about 40 years old and is revealing signs of age throughout, absolutely replace. Nowadays, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it may be an acceptable alternative to do simply that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless may no longer be an alternative.</p>
