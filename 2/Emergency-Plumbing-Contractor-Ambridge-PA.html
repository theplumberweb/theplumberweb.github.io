<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed procedure. Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.
