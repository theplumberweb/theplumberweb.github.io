<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible option, especially when simple plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your house and household.</p>
