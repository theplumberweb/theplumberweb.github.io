<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leaks under the sink to verify that your plumber's putty is making a good seal. Remove the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leaks and tighten up as essential. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cords as desired.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the property (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are thought about safe for the majority of fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line avoids them from closing completely, backflow can happen.</p>
