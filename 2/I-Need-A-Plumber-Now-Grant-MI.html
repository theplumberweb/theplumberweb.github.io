<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
