<p>Backflow is bad news. The prevention of backflow pollutants into drinkable water supply is crucialÂ not just in industrial and commercial applications, however likewise in residential systems. Conbraco, Febco, and Wilkins are three of the largest providers of industrial-grade backflow prevention assemblies.Â Control your water supply and pressure with a backflow preventer listed here.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification. I have actually talked to a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
