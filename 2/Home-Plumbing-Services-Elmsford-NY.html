<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is generally made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would normally cause rust. After extended usage, these rods will ultimately become worn and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you might experience significant problems with your hot water heater very rapidly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. If the water turns off, you may have the ability to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed correctly (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
