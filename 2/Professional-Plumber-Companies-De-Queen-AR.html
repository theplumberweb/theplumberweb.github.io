<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of flow in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can only stream in one instructions. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to assist battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The need upstream could trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings impurities back to the primary water system system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
