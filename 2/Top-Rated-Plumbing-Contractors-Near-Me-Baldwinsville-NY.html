<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Baldwinsville NY</h3>

A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in very unusual cases where the structure is considered to not position a risk to the supply of water, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
