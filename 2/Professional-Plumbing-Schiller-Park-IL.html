<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; extra, more substantial expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for citizens. If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help determine.</p>

A backflow preventer not just safeguards drinking water in individual houses, it likewise prevents wastewater in personal houses from receding out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
