<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in studs, floors, and joists. Finally, a quality contractor will not threat working with an inferior plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and suits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>
