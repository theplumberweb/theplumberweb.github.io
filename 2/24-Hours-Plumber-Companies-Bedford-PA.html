The kind of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, copper, clay or plastic, will identify the extent of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of circulation in a potable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only flow in one direction.

If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to assist battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream might cause a reversal in flow.</p>
