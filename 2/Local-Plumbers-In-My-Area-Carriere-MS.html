<p>If a cable television has not yet been gone to the junction box, you can make the connections within the new disposer any time in advance, signing up with the cable to the wires in the box right before or simply after mounting the disposer. Garbage disposals are quite easy to keep. The most essential thing to remember is that they are actually food disposals. Items that would otherwise go in the garbage should not be placed in your disposal.
