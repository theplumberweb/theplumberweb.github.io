<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal proof that specific magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be effective in avoiding scale development in difficult water supply. It is really difficult to evaluate such claims, which are almost never ever based on tests that are well adequate explained to permit others to assess them and to confirm the outcomes. While the absence of "clinical" evidence does not in itself invalidate a claim for the efficacy of a device, it should make one hesitate to accept it without some warranty of performance.</p>
