<p>3. Solar Salt comes from vaporized seawater and might often leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in tubs and sinks. The pink movie is in fact a harmless bacteria that comes from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) advises switching to one of the other two types of salts if this stain is an inconvenience in your home. As soon as the brand-new salt has had a chance to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then acquire some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as instructed in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>
