Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
