<p>Lots of property owners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their clogged or unclean drain problems. These chemicals are simple to use and economical, but they harm your pipes and their effects are only short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize severe chemicals to eat away at the clog and with duplicated usage, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe creating weak points that are prone to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next step would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail underneath the area to capture water then unscrew the two threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, a lot of kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
