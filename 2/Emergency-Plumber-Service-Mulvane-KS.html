Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no way to offer one, then we inspect to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
