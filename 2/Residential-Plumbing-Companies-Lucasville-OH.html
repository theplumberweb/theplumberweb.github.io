<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
