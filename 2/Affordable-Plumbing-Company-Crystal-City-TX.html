For one, they may damage your pipes and on a bigger scale, these chemicals aren't environmentally friendly. It's best to rely on the team at Wilson Plumbing & Heating to handle your issue safely and with care.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation.
