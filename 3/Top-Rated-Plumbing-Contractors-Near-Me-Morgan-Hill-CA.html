<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>

<p>This is one of the first and main questions that you should ask yourself when it pertains to repiping and replacing plumbing in your house.

If your house was constructed prior to the 1970s, we highly recommend that you employ a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and examine if there are areas that need repiping. If your house was built decades prior to that, opportunities are that your home might need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can function at ideal rates.</p>
