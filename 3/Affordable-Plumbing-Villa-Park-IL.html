<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Villa Park IL 60181</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use an option of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise natural products, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work better than products containing harsh chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with recognized backflow gadgets on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape irrigation systems, pool, and hot tubs.

Relying on the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
