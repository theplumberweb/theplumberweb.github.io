<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and elaborate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
