<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of years, however steel ultimately experiences corrosion and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>After the pipe is cleaned, we move to utilize our repairs as rapidly and efficiently as possible. Our equipment is trenchless-based, and the liner we insert into the sewer line is able to pump up in order to apply the epoxy resin. The resin is given a couple of hours to completely solidify and cure, and after the sewer pipe line repair process is finished, our customers are offered with a new sewer line that will add to the overall quality of the sewer system for several years. Expected to last fifty years or more, these sewer lines are created to be durable and effective, resisting deterioration and other common problems that can afflict other pipeline material types.</p>
