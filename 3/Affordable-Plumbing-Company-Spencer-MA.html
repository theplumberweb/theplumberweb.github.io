<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally kept at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
