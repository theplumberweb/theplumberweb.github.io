<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and intricate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the home and location of the pipe, it was a hard job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working prior to they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
