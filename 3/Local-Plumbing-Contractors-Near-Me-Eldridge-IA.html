Most of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and comfort. Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It really isn't a great concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have actually been specifically created to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or won't disperse your weight equally and could ultimately trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>

If the drains clog periodically however you can normally flush them out, this may be a smaller sized clog like a buildup of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap residue from the bathroom. Little clogs can develop into big ones fairly quickly.</p>
