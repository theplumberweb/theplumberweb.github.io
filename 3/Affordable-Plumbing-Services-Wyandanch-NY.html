<p>Inspect the home's warm water heater You will be seeking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of 4 must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the water heater's age. Check to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be heated and offered for use. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a short life. Demand that a new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of rust.</p>
