<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
