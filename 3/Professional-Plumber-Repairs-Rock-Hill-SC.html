Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable water supply within a building these devices are referred to as isolation" BFP. Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no way to supply one, then we examine to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>
<p>If you need to maintain a backflow preventer in your fire security system, make certain to have a look at our selection of Backflow Examine Key Tools and Tool Sets They painlessly remove or install camera checks found in Ames and Watts double check and lowered pressure zone backflow prevention assemblies.
