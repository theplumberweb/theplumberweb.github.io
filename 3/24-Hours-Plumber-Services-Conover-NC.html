<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow.
