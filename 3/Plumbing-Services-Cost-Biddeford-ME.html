<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
