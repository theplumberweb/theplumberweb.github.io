The reasons for this can range from leakages, defective or malfunctioning electrical circuitry, or a broken heating component or thermostat. If it is among the pointed out problems, a repair or replacement of the parts may suffice. However, if the water heater system has all of these problems taking place often, then a water heater replacement is required.</p>
