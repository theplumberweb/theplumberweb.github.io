<p>Surface Area Accelerated Formation is a creation that simulates biomineralization, the system frequently recognized for structured development in the environment, including seashells. Water softening is achieved with SACr by utilizing proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads speed up the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to entirely remove momentary solidity in water.</p>
