When these parts wear, they lead to tiny leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as soon as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also lead to flooding and water damage.</p>

Typically, apprenticeship programs last anywhere from 4 to 5 years.</p>
