<p>You may be lured to weld or spot a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to conserve money.

You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roof vents or take out a toilet. This is usually more labor-intensive and might need extra costs.
