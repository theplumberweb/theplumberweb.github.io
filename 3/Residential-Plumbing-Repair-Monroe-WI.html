<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. CenterPoint Energy's House Service Plus provides you an optional Pipe Security Plan for just $3.95 a month. It covers interior, readily accessible, gas pipes running from the gas meter to your natural gas devices. Auto-reverse setting: Some garbage disposals come with this setting, which reverses the instructions the blades spin to clear waste. This safeguards the blades so they do not wear as quick.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this accreditation. I've contacted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
