<h3>Discover Why Plumbing Services Are Expensive Wellford SC</h3>
<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leaks under the sink to validate that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and enable the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leakages and tighten as required. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cords as wanted.</p>
