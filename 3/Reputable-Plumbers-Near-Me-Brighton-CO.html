Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

Based upon the condition of the line, it may be an appropriate alternative to do just that. Nevertheless, if the balanced out worsens trenchless might no longer be a choice.</p>
