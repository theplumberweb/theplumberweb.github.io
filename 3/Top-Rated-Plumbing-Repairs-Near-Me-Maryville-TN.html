Selecting a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is a good idea. The energy effectiveness of a storage water heater is shown by its Energy Aspect (EF).

You also need to think about the fuel source.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
