<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
