<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently due to the fact that hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, need to use increasingly more detergent to attain the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and sanitized during regeneration. Lastly, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
