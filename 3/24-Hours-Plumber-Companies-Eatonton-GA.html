<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent guy. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as guaranteed. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>While not every state needs insurance coverage before contractor licenses are issued, having your own guarantees the safety of your organisation. Unexpected occasions and unwanted scenarios may take place anytime and being unprepared can put your company in huge monetary difficulty. To be safe instead of sorry, getting the best insurance coverage for your plumbing company works as a defense versus monetary threats and organisation jeopardies.</p>
