<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this method, you know the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>

Based on the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable choice to do just that. Nevertheless, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be an alternative.</p>
