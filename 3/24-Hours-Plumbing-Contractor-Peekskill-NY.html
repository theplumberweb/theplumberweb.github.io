<p>This kind of valve is utilized on agricultural locations. It is meant to keep the local water system clean in the existence of numerous farming pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals. Using these products is called chemigation. There are several elements to this valve. The check valve has a spring ran flapper, which enables flow in just one direction. There is also a low pressure drain and an air vacuum release valve in the device. The last component is the injection port.

While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>
