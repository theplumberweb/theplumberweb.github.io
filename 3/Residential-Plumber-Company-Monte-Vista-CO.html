<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.

To prevent this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or purchase one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>
