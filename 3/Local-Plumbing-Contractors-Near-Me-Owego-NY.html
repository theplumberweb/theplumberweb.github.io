<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make certain to take the appropriate safety measures if using among these items.</p>
