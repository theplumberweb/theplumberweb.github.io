<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will establish. In some cases the option is to repair the damaged section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is required to fix the problem. Other times a more extensive solution is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>Among our many professional services at Ryan's Plumbing is toilet repair. A clog or leak in a toilet can trigger water damage to your house if not fixed quickly. Doing a toilet repair yourself can be tricky if you aren't well versed in plumbing repair, so we suggest you leave it to Ryan's Plumbing to get your toilet working rapidly again.</p>
