It is important that the repair technician understands the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>When pipes are set up into a vertical kind it is referred to as a hydrostatic loop. In this configuration the loop must be greater than 33 feet to function appropriately. When created in this manner it prevents siphoning and backflow into a water system.
