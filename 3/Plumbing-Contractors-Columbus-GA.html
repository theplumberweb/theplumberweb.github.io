<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.

A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
