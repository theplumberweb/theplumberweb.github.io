<p>Is your house 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main product used in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it generally catches rust after about 50 years and needs replacement. Even more modern-day pipes won't last permanently, so watch on plumbing systems that might be reaching completion of their lifespan.</p>

<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some obstructions. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>

If your plumber requires a permit to repair the gas leak, which they'll most likely need to carry out in the Atlanta city area, the charges to pull the permit will add to your repair cost.
