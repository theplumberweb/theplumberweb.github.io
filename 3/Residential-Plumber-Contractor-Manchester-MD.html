<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal can be found in 2 standard types - continuous feed, which generally has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in location to operate the system. Continuous feed is common and the easiest to use; a batch feed model is much safer however can be slower to utilize on big quantities of food waste because you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company offers an overview of garbage disposal types and designs.</p>
<p>This is always the # 1 concern for any legitimate professional. Plumbing can be a harmful job, and can adversely impact everyone living in the house when completed improperly.
