Exemptions, which are approved in exceptionally uncommon cases where the building is considered to not posture a risk to the water system, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
