<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
