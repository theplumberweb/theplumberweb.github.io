The only purpose of salt in a water softener is to regrow the resin beads that take the solidity out of water.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, but if your toilet is obstructing more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger issue to examine. If your toilet is reasonably new, you might need to switch bathroom tissue or work with a plumber to clear a clog from the drain. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can look up your state's licensing info. Examine the list of state licensing agencies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
