<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient operating a requirement more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
