<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services North Hollywood CA</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>To make it easy, homeowners with testable backflow devices are expected to have them evaluated by a certified tester each year.
