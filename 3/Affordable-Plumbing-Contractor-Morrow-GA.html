<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit is available in two fundamental types - continuous feed, which generally has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover remain in place to run the system. Continuous feed is common and the most convenient to utilize; a batch feed design is more secure but can be slower to use on large amounts of food waste because you need to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company offers an overview of garbage disposal types and styles.</p>
<p>The most common approach for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another component, usually salt. Sodium will not cause lime scale or soap scum buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds only an extremely small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is considered very low salt" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
