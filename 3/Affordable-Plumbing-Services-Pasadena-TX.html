<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing installed during building and construction of a brand-new or refurbished structure is installed by educated artisans in accordance with suitable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains.

Nevertheless, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining pipes fixture itself. Blockages in a fixture can cause damaging damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
