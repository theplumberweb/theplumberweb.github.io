<p>Old, worn, or damaged plumbing pipes can trigger considerable problems. Even little leakages can gradually dampen walls and floorings up until they become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes might end up being rusty and add rust to the water supply. Gurgling noise from pipes. A strange, gurgling noise coming from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never a good sign. Possibilities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not be enough to resolve this problem. Call a plumber immediately.</p>
