<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in particular communities, based on our experience.</p>

<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that takes place in the earth's crust and is also in some cases formed by the rotting of raw materials like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. However, to prevent off that risk, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which gives it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking. Ensure to only trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>

<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
