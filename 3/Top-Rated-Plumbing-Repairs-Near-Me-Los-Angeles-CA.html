<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Los Angeles CA 90011</h3>
<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 used to eliminate wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk includes the earliest recognized examples of brick constructed Latrines, built atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later on utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had easily removable and exchangeable sections, and allowed for cleaning.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the perpetrator. However not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with too little slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>If you have an older house, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This rust can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have many unfavorable results on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
