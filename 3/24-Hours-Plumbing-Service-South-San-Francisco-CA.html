The very best way to decrease build-up is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is specifically hard with high mineral content, you might need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>

<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this large quantity of trash does not need to go in the garbage can.

By setting up a waste disposal unit you are assisting the environment by saving the amount of garbage that gets sent to land fills and other discarding locations. With a waste disposal unit the trash is managed through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
