<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Waunakee WI</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure requires a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in very unusual cases where the building is considered to not pose a risk to the supply of water, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
