<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature is maintained at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water flows immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small loading dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard protection assembly.</p>
