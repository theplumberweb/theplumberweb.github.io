<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard protection assembly.</p>
