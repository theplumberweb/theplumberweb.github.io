<p>Backflow is bad news. The prevention of backflow impurities into potable water supply is crucialÂ not only in industrial and commercial applications, however also in residential systems. Conbraco, Febco, and Wilkins are 3 of the largest suppliers of industrial-grade backflow prevention assemblies.Â Control your water system and pressure with a backflow preventer listed here.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification.
