<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
