<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
