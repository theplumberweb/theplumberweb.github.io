Assemblies not presently noted need to have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>The kinds of backflow preventers the company supplies include double check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel models), and lowered pressure zone assemblies. Suggestion: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, remove the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet before mounting the disposal. Likewise connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you connect the P-trap.</p>
<p>Consider all the areas water streams in and out of your home. These are the areas that a professional assessment ought to cover.
