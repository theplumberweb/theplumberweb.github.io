<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task cleaning up after it also.</p>
