<p>Suggestion: Check with local codes prior to trying to install a garbage disposal. Some communities have plumbing codes that don't allow disposals since of limitations on sewer capacity.

We provide affordable Orange County hot water heater replacements and repairs to consumers throughout the area. Our plumbers draw on decades of experience to do the job quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer system calculates the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
