<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great guy. He informed me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as guaranteed. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be higher.</p>
<p>However, you also need to think about the age of your unit. If your system is getting close to 10 years old, it's generally not smart to spend for repairs if they are worth more than half of the rate of a brand-new unit. If problems end up being more frequent with an older system, then it is advised that you have the garbage disposal changed. We offer a number of highly efficient and affordable systems, and supply upfront rates prior to work begins so there are no surprises. It is our goal to offer all of our valued consumers throughout Albuquerque and the surrounding locations the service they need at a price they can afford.</p>
