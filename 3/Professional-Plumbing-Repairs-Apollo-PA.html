<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a practical option, specifically when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous downsides to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>
