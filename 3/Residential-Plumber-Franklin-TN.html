<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the best length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop if the old discharge tube is too brief. To prevent this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation package includes a tube, or purchase one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Many softeners have a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to provide some type of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it.
