<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing set up throughout building and construction of a new or renovated building is set up by knowledgeable craftsmen in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the meals, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally understand your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining component itself. Blockages in a fixture can trigger destructive damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
