<p>Clogged toilets are one of the most common plumbing concerns plumbers face, and for many individuals, it's an emergency when the toilet is prepared to overflow. You can attempt to fix the clog yourself by utilizing a plunger, which you can purchase your local hardware store. The only function of salt in a water softener is to regenerate the resin beads that take the firmness out of water.</p>
<p>Carefully lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed effectively (Picture 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is failing and will need to be replaced. If it is in a garage and a small sluggish leak, schedule a quote as quickly as possible and ensure absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be possibly damaged. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
