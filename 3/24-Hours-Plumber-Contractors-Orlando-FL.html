<p>Camera are among the most important tools in the plumbing organisation. When searching for a new flapper, your best choice is to try and discover the same flapper that initially included your existing flush valve. The simplest way to do that is by looking up your toilet design and picking the flapper advised for that model. If you do not know your design number, however, we do offer a comprehensive selection of "will fit" flappers to assist you out. See the video listed below for more information about the different kinds of flappers offered, or see How To Replace Toilet Flappers for short tutorials on changing toilet flappers, tank balls, and flush valve seals.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Dual Checks. There are 2 other kinds of backflow preventers readily available that you may face. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check". It is NOT the same thing as a Check even though it might be marketed as one! Don't get swindled! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses comparable to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>
