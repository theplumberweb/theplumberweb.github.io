<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need. When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure.

Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to make sure no valves were mistakenly exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
