<p>Some producers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
