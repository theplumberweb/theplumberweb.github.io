<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
