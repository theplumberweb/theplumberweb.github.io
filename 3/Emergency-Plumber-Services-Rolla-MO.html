<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank.

<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair specialist knows the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
