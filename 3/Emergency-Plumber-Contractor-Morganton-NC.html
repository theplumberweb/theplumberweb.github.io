<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most typical sink repair problems. Typical adequate that lots of people choose diy repairs. But in some cases even identifying the leak can be an issue. It could be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, waste disposal unit fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor knows the telltale signs of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in joists, studs, and floors. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with an inferior plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and make complex the job with insurance claims, lost time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>
