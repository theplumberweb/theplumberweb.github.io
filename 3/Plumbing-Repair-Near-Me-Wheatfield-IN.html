As soon as the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit should not leak. It generally shows wear and tear which is a reasonable sign that its time is up when this occurs.

The kitchen sink drain may need a simple tightening up or a replacement. If the leak remains in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the apparent spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you may have to fill the sink with water prior to analyzing the pipe beneath.</p>
