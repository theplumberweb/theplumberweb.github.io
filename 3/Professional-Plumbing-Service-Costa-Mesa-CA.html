<p>Changing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complicated than replacing with a various model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this might be something to consider. An entirely various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink port needs to be puttied into location. A safe seal is a must. As soon as connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to link wires properly, and the base covered to secure the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
