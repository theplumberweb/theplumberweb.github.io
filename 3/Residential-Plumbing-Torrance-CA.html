<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system.

Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
