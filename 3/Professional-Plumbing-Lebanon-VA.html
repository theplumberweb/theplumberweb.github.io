<h3>Clogged Drain Services in Lebanon VA 24266</h3>
<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to clogs that come from inside the home. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root invasion. When tree roots start to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, plastic, copper or clay, will identify the degree of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>On and off does any structural damage occur as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is normally found before it triggers any significant damage. The water leak is generally the size of a pinhole.

Leaked water generally remains under your home and saturates into the ground soil. If the home's foundation was not properly compacted, this can possibly trigger a cavity.
