The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you might have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's adjusted effectively (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not have to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
