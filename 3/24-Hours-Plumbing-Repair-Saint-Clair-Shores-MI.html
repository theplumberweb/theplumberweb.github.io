<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The technician switched off the supply of water and loosened the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to eliminate the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture. The customer helped our specialist in moving the toilet back into its correct area, and the specialist tightened the bolts prior to bring back the water supply and ensuring that the toilet was effectively flushing.</p>
<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the material. To maintain your health, security, and home comfort, we utilize just the very best piping: polyethylene. Lots of homes and businesses utilize galvanized pipes for water flow, which tend to deteriorate and can negatively affect our health.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
