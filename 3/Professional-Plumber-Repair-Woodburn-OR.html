<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
