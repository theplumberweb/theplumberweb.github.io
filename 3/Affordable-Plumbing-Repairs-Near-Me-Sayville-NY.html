<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will develop.

<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that certain magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be efficient in preventing scale development in hard water supply. It is very hard to evaluate such claims, which are nearly never ever based upon tests that are well enough described to permit others to evaluate them and to verify the results. While the absence of "clinical" evidence does not in itself invalidate a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it ought to make one hesitate to accept it without some assurance of performance.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
