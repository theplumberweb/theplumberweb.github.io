Water conditioners are gadgets that assist avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total.
