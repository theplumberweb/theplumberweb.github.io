<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
