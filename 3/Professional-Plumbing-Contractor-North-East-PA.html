<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing set up during building of a new or remodelled structure is set up by knowledgeable craftsmen in accordance with suitable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or pour flat soda in your sink, you normally know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining fixture itself. Clogs in a fixture can cause destructive damage to your draining pipes system the longer they continue.</p>
