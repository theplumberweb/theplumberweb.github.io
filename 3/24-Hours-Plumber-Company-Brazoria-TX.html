<p>In this circumstance, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You likewise need to purchase a backflow valve if you see your water has an unusual flow, smell, color or taste. A plumbing professional can identify whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other issues in your home's plumbing system. More complicated concerns with water temperature level or pressure may require changing the hot water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to get this accreditation. I've checked with a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
