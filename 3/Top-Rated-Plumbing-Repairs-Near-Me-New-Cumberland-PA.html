When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
