Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat working with a substandard plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>
