<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.

This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
