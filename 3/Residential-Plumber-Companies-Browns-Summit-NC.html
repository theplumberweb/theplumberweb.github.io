<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there need to be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you must probably not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners generally have a life expectancy of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are correctly preserved.
