<p>Some makers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will ultimately take its toll. If you discover that your plumbing suffers from numerous clogs, leaks, and water pressure variation that no amount of repairs seems to stem, you must speak with a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as an option. Property owners need to examine water pressure entering their house on a routine basis. Water pressure must be about 55 to 60 PSI; some city water pressure can can be found in at over 100 PSI.</p>
