<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Phoenixville PA 19460</h3>
<p>When the potable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively safeguarded, non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of circulation in a potable water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help fight a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The need upstream might trigger a turnaround in circulation.</p>
