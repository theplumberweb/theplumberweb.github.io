<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>There are 2 main kinds of backflow systems: air space (AG) and reduced pressure valve assembly (RPZ). It's estimated that everyone uses around 80-100 gallons of water a day. That's a lot of water.
