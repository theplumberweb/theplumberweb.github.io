<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a feasible solution, especially when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
