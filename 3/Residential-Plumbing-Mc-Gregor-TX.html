Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
