<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
