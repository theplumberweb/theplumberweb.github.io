<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to identify.</p>
<p>While city water does get treated, it is provided for functions of removing bacterial concerns and making the water drinkable.
