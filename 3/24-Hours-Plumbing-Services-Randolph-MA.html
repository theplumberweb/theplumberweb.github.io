<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>While not every state requires insurance prior to contractor licenses are released, having your own warranties the security of your service. Undesirable situations and unexpected events may occur anytime and being unprepared can put your organisation in substantial monetary trouble. To be safe rather than sorry, getting the right insurance coverage for your plumbing company acts as a defense versus monetary risks and organisation jeopardies.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing property owners want to get their hands filthy with. It needs more than just elbow grease to fix broken sewer systems, and the difficulty is frequently due to how problematic it is to evaluate the damage. This is much more bothersome if the damage is irreparable or needs more comprehensive repair, specifically in commercial settings.</p>
