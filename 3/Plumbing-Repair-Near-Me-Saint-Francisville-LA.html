<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
