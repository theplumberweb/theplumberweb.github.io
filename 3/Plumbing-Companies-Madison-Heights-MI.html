<h3>Sewer Inspection in Madison Heights Michigan</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
