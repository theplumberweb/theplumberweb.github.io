If you have a historical home, we can discover a drain that will look good with your existing décor. Step the height of your old water heater and buy a new one the same height so you don't need to change the length of the water, gas or electrical lines.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
