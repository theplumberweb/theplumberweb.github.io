<p>As soon as the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
