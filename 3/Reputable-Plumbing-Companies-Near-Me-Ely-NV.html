<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Service in Ely</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Looking to repair or replace your garbage disposal? The California Plumbing License Exam is needed in order to work as a licensed contractor in California Any person who means to work as a plumbing contractor that is responsible for building, changing, or repairing a building or structure needs to be licensed. This is particularly so if the total cost of the job goes beyond or is $500.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I've checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
