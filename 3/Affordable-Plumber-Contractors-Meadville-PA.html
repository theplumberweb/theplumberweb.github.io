<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated up straight whenever it's required. Tankless systems specifically use a component that warms up water when the tap is turned on.

Tankless electric water heaters use less power than traditional water heaters since they just heat water when required.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
