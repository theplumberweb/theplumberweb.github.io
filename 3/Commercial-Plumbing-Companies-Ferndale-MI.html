Low Water Pressure: When there is excessive sediment accumulation in your drain lines, it may cause problems for your water pressure. If you are experiencing poor water pressure, think about hiring a plumber to see if there is sediment build-up or another kind of clog in your system.</p>
<h3>Clogged Tub Drain in Ferndale Michigan</h2>
<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water supply goes beyond the pressure in the potable system providing the make-up water. This can force the potable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Possible pollutants can then go into the drinkable water system. The best way to minimize accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is specifically tough with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
