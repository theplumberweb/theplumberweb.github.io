Excess Hair: Your shower or bathtub is often ground no for blockages. As hair combines with soap, it can create the perfect storm for plumbing obstructions. Over time, these obstructions can intensify and prevent your bathtub from draining pipes at all.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A number of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures if utilizing among these products.</p>
