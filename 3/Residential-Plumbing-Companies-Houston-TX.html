<p>Backflow is a potential problem in a water system since it can spread contaminated water back through a distribution system. For example, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any real or prospective connection between the public water supply and a source of contamination or pollution) can enable pollutants or contaminants to go into the safe and clean water system. Illness can arise from ingesting water that has actually been infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
