<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and elaborate plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can cause corrosion that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and eliminates from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
