<p>In this situation, dirty water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you discover your water has an unusual circulation, color, taste or smell. A plumbing professional can determine whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other problems in your house's plumbing system. More complex problems with water temperature level or pressure might need changing the water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capability and type.</p>
