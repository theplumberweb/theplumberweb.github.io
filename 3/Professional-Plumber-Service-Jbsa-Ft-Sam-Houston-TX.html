<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main sewers traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool producer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done independently. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as 2 hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>
