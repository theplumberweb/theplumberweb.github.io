Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
