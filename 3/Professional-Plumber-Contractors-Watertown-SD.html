<p>We recommend that homeowners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber a minimum of once per year to clean out the drains and keep everything running smoothly.

<p>Tip: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and check the flange and drain for leakages. Backflow - Do you observe water coming back in your sink or shower?

When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
