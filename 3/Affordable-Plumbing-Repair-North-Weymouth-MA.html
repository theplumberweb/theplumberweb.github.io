<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a tough job because of the age of the house and area of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
