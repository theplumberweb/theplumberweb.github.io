<p>The Plumbing Bureau's main focus is on safety within a building. Plumbing inspections ensure that water supply in structures are linked properly, without any cross-connection to pollute drinkable water systems.

<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable solution, especially when basic plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
