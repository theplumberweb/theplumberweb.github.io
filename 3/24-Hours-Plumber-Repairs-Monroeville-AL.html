You, for that reason, have to use increasingly more detergent to attain the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Lastly, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
