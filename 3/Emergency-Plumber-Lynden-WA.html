<p>While combating a fire, firefighters are not surprisingly more concerned about drawing adequate water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any available source to achieve their objective, but fire department lorries frequently carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This rust can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have many negative results on your health. Corroded pipes also cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
