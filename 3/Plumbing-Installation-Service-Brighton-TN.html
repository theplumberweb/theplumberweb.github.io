<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter season freezing. The brand-new pipe, made from a modern, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls.

Depending on the scope of work being performed and the type of building, you may have one or more inspections.</p>

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a practical option, specifically when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your house and family.</p>
