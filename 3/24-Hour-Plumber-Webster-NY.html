Some property owners will attempt to dislodge the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda.

<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. This large quantity of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can if it can easily and quickly be dealt with through the sink.

By setting up a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by conserving the amount of trash that gets sent out to land fills and other discarding areas. With a waste disposal unit the trash is managed through already existing water facilities.</p>
