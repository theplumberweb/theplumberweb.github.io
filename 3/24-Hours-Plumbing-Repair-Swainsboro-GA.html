<p>Some pipe materials are less expensive than others; some are more brittle and susceptible to splitting, displacement or other types of structural failure. Other materials are susceptible to deterioration and rust while some are unaffected.

When these parts break, they lead to small leakages that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as quickly as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can likewise lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
