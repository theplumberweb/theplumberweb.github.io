<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding.

When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regrowth).

The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
