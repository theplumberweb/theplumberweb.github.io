<p>The best way to handle high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities website is by setting up a pressure lowering valve (PRV). A PRV will control water pressure as it comes into the home. According to San Diego utilities, a PRV can likewise help to save water as fixtures in the house will utilize less water when the pressure is at a lower and more workable PSI.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
