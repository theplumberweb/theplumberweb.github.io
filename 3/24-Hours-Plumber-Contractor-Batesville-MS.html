<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Batesville MS 38606</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
