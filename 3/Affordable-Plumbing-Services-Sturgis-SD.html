If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
