<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had excellent evaluations and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great task cleaning up after it also.</p>
