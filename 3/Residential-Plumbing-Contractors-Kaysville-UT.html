It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>

It is essential that the repair service technician understands the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized.
