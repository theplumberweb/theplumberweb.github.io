<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques at Warren RI 02885</h3>
<p>Very first consider your alternatives if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has started to leak. A full sewer pipe replacement might not be necessary. Often, relining your existing pipes is a better alternative. If your sewer lines are underneath trees, near extensive landscaping, walkways, driveways or other semi-permanent functions, total sewer excavation can trigger a great deal of collateral damage (and cost) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the offender. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>Typically, the cost to replace a toilet varies in between $ 122 and $228, with the majority of property owners investing around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the cost of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for a total toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with extra functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're replacing an existing toilet, add $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
