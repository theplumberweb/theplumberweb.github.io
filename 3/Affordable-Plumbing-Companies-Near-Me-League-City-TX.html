<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets need to definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet needs to be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>
