<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical service is to have the defective pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

If you discover that your plumbing suffers from various clogs, leaks, and water pressure variation that no amount of repairs appears to stem, you need to seek advice from a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as an option. House owners should inspect water pressure entering into their home on a regular basis.

As rust and minerals develop in time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you may see lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can end up being a health risk in your water.</p>
