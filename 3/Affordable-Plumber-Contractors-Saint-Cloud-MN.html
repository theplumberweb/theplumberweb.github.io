<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Saint Cloud MN</h3>
<p>Contrary to what many think, having a garbage disposal in fact protects your pipes and extends their lifespan. Food cleaned down a drain unintentionally or on purpose without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, causing blockages and gradually damaging your plumbing system. Tiny food particles created by a garbage disposal wash straight down easily.</p>

Salt won't cause lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening adds just a really small amount of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about extremely low sodium" by the Fda.</p>
