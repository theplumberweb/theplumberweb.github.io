<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less quickly. Water softening can prevent these negative effects. Gas is a colorless, odor free fuel. As a security preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives natural gas an odor typically associated with rotten eggs. If it takes place, this unique aroma allows you to smell a possible leak. If you believe a leak, constantly leave.</p>
