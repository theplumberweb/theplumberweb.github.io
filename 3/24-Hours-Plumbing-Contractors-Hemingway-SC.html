<p>Once per year to clean out the drains and keep whatever running efficiently, we recommend that property owners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least. It's also useful because, at the exact same time, the plumber can expect the drains and advise any drain repair, or drain cleaning service. Often whatever is blocking the drain won't budge.

<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
