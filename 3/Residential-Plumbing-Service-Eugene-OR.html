When a brand-new house is developed, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, sinks and faucets need to be set up properly and to local, state, and federal code.

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a practical option, particularly when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your house and household.</p>
