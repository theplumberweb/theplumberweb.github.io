<p>To determine if your house is a poly house," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it enters the home near the water heater. Your main shut off is attached to the end of the water pipe. Make certain you examine both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
