<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are looked for leakages or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them changed immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you need to first get the required permit( s) for the work you plan to do. You can have a look at our Authorization page to learn more on acquiring a license.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement.
