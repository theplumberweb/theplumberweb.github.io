<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Requirement for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for carrying out yearly forward flow tests are sometimes viewed as a mandate to have them. However the intent of the code is to just connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention test sets and repair parts are a must for the avid do-it-yourselfer. Our backflow test packages are compatible with all minimized pressure principle, check valve, spill resistant, and pressure vacuum breaker type backflow preventers. All our packages are portable and compact, and include the required evaluates, tubes, and adapter fittings.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
