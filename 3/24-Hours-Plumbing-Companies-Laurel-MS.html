The age of your home is a crucial element to understand whether or not you need to repipe your home. This is not just due to the fact that your plumbing has aged with time, but also because houses that were built before a particular time period are more likely to consist of galvanized steel, understood to be a metal that is out-of-date on the planet of plumbing and beyond due to its sensitivity to rust. If your home was constructed prior to the 1970s, we highly advise that you hire a plumbing professional to check your home's plumbing and inspect if there are locations that need repiping. Possibilities are that your home may need extensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at optimum rates if your house was built decades before that.</p>
