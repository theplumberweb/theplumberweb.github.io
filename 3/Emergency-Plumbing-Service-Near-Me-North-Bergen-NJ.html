<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is consisted of six State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, one of which is also functions as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Strategy Inspector for the group. Toilets conserve lives. It may sound crazy, but it's true. Correct sanitation in the form of operating toilets and properly maintained sewer system assists avoid potentially life-threatening illness from attacking you and your family.
