<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we suggest you very first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the proper preventative measures if utilizing one of these items.</p>
