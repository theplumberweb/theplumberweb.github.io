Once the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
