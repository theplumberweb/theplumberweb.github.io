<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
