<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed.
