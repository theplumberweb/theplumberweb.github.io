<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than constant or direct) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
