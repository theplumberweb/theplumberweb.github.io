<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to detect.</p>
