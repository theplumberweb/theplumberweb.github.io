<p>Gas leaks are commonly found at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that enables connections and disconnections of gas devices. A quick way to identify a gas leak is if you use liquid dish soap to the believed area. You likely have a gas leak and should immediately get in touch with a gas plumber to carry out an emergency gas line repair if it bubbles.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
