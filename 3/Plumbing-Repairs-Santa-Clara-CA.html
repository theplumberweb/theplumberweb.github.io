<h3>How To Choose An Exceptional Plumbing Service Santa Clara CA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
