<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of keeping the stability and effectiveness of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace solidity ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other.

When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
