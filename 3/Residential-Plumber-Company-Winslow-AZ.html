Galvanized steel (typically known simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is fairly costly, and hard to deal with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements usually found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications.

<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working effectively since tough water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use increasingly more cleaning agent to attain the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Finally, water consisting of the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
