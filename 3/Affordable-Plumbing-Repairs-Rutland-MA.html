<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>

You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
