Our repair processes rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws caused by waste accumulation can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls effectively. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all instructions to permit the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and provide a careful cleaning.</p>
