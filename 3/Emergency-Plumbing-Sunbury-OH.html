<p>Lots of homeowners think their utility companies or property owners insurance coverage is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the reality is that in a lot of cases you, the property owner, are accountable. The majority of basic property owners insurance plan and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems around your house.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger difficulty too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
