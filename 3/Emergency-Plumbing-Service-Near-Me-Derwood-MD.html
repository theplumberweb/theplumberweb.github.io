Camera are useful in finding buried septic tanks or examining the condition of buried pipes to figure out proper maintenance schedules or the degree of needed repairs.

Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
