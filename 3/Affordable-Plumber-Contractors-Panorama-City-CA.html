<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this accreditation. I've talked to a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the price to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
