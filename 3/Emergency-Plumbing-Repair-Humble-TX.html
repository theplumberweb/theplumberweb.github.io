<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that depends on extremely technical knowledge and specialized equipment to identify the area of leaks throughout the city's water distribution system and pinpoint the location of those leaks at which noticeable water may or may not have surfaced.

<p>If the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a new burner set and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
