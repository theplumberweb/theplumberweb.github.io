Licensing, registration and other tester-specific information is also available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Details ).</p>
<p>The correct repair of a backflow preventer requires lots of items to be assessed. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly need to be evaluated.
