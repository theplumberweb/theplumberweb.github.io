<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects.
