Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
