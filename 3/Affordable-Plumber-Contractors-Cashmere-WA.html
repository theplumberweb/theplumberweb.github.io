<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regrowth generally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>

Hard water causes these problems due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to stress over any concerns with mineral deposits sticking around.
