<p>Household operated and owned since 2003, RT Plumbing Services delivers industry-leading plumbing expertise, house redesigning service, and water heater conversions and replacements to the greater Fort Worth, TX community. It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a properly working RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations subject to water damage. Adequate drainage should also be offered.</p>
