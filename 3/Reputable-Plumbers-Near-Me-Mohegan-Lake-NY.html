If, say, you need a new burner set and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
