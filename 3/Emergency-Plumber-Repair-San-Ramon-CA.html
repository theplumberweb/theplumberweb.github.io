<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a fantastic guy. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as promised. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be higher.</p>
<p>The typical toilet will last for decades and have very little problems that can be quickly fixed without replacement. However, when it is time for toilet replacement, it is very important to have a licensed and skilled plumber handle the job. At Morrison Plumbing, Heating and Air, we have more than thirty years of experience with toilet installation and toilet replacement. Whether you need a new toilet for a bathroom remodel, moving into a brand-new house, or just wanting to update your existing toilet, we ensure that our installation process won't harm your home or its plumbing system.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
