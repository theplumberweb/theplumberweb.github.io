<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic man. He informed me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and provided as assured. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be higher.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable option, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your home and household.</p>
