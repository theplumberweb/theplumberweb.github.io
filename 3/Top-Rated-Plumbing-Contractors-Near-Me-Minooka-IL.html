I selected this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a reasonable cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
