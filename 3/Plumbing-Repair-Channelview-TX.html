You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
