<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, state, you need a brand-new burner set and the hot water heater is five years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>

Tankless electrical hot water heater use less power than standard water heaters since they only heat water when needed.</p>
