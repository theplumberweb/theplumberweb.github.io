<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
