<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the defective pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation.

The reason it is used in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
