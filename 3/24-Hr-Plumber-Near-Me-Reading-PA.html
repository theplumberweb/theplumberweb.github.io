<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

Depending on the seriousness of the circumstance, only one piece may need replacement, or the whole under-sink assembly must be eliminated and changed.

Poorly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, should be reconfigured.</p>
