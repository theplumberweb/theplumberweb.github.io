<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
