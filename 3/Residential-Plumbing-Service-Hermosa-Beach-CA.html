Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
