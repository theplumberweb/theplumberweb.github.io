<p>Pipeline video inspection is a kind of telepresence used to visually examine the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A typical application is for a plumber to determine the condition of small size sewer lines and household connection drain pipes.

<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
