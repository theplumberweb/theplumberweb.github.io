<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent person. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as promised. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70.
