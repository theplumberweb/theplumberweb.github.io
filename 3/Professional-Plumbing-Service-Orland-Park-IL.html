Secondary backflow approaches provide an increased level of protection for the general public supply of water system.</p>
<p>5. Pour warm water down your drain after utilizing the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, wash your drain with a bit of warm water.

Poorly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, must be reconfigured.</p>
