<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less important things that can weaken or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
