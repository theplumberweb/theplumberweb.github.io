<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit.

<p>In the kitchen, you may have a farmhouse or apron sink, a bar sink, an undermount sink, or a cast iron sink, maybe with an enamel plating.
