<p>Often triggered by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and examine if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is usually the fix. Alternatively, sometimes a malfunctioning fill valve might actuate intermittently, also. Water won't drain or is draining pipes gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently because hard water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use more and more cleaning agent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and sanitized throughout regrowth. Finally, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
