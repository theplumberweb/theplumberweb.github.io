<p>When sewer line breaks, it frequently triggers the yard above it to become soaked. You might smell the disgusting odor of sewage before you feel the squish of your yard under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it necessary to cordon off that part of your lawn. The situation is laden with problems since the swampiness will bring in undesirable animals.
