<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the wallet of a homeowner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department must meet or go beyond the state requirements and bring the responsibility for implementing them.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main sewers traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
