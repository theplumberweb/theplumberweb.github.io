<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first shot utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make certain to take the proper preventative measures if utilizing one of these products.</p>
