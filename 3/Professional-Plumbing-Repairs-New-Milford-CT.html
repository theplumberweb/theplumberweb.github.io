<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused option of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water travelling through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
