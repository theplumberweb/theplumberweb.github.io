<p>As soon as the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage turned off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
