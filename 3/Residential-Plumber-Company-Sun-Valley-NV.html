<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
