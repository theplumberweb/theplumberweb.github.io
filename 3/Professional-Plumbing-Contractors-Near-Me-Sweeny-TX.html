<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and intricate plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping.

Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and takes away from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
