<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
