<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct result on your security, convenience, convenience, and dependability than your plumbing system. The most common drain issue we are required is issues with drainage, such as a sink or tub that is slow to drain. Normally, drainage problems are an indication that there is a clog or accumulation inside your drains which needs to be cleared out. Our Santa Fe drain cleaning professionals have all of the necessary training and tools to clear and check out your drains.</p>
<p>While city water does get dealt with, it is provided for purposes of removing bacterial concerns and making the water drinkable.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.
