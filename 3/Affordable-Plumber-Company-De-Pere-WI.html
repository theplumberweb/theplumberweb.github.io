<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and detailed plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard job due to the fact that of the age of your house and area of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
