A standard by hand run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
