<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or short-term connection between a public water system or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a private water system surpasses the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can trigger typical circulation to reverse, backpressure takes place. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a greater floor may trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains must be performed on all drains, including toilet, floor, sink and tub drains.</p>
