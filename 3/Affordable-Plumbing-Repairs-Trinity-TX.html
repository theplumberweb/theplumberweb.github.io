A lot of standard house owners insurance plan and local energy companies or towns do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems in and around your home.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour.
