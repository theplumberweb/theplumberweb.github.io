Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on.
