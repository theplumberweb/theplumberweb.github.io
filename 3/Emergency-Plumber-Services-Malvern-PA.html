<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Malvern PA</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
