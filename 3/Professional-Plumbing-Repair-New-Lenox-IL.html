<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Hard water stops washing detergents and cosmetic cleansers from working as effectively. When washing items are used in tough water - hard water ions bond with surfactants making them not available to bond with water. Any location where water is included is prone to clogged drains. Your drains are especially vulnerable to obstructions and other blockages because of the quantity of usage they get and all the different things that we put down them. No matter what's blocking your drain, the expert plumbers at Larry & Sons can clear it with ease.</p>
