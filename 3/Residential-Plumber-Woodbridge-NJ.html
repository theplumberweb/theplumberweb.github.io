When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to pass through. Due to the fact that of the tight space, the pipes frequently make strange gurgling sounds as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are available, resulting in the strange noises emanating from your sink.</p>
