<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>
