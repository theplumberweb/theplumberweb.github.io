You, therefore, have to utilize more and more detergent to achieve the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and sanitized throughout regrowth. Lastly, water consisting of the tough minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
