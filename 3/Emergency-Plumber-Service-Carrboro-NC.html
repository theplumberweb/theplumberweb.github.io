Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the safe and clean water system within a structure these gadgets are known as seclusion" BFP. Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no way to supply one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>

But while small drips need to not be trigger for concern, house owners should keep an eye on the water heater leaks. When we required a leak in a pipe fixed, I had a terrific experience with Gotelli Plumbing. Tom was friendly and professional.
