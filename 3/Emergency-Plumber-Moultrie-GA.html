<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to prevent winter season freezing. The brand-new pipe, made from a state-of-the-art, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls.

<p>You reside in an older house. There's an excellent chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever replaced its pipes.

If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
