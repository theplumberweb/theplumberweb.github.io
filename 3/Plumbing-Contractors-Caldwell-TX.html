<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water system line feeds the tough water into the tank.

Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an undesirable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries pollutants back to the main water supply system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
