<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused solution of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank.
