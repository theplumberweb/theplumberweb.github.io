<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed due to the fact that of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
