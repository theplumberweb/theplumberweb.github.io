<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
