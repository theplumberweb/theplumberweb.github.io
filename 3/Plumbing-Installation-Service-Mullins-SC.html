<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Mullins SC</h3>
<p>Malfunctioning plumbing and fixtures can be more than a nuisance: It can cost you cash in increased water bills and cause structural damage to your home. 10 percent of houses nationwide have leaks in their plumbing that waste more than 90 gallons of water a day, according to the U.S. Epa. Repairing those leakages can save you 10 percent on your water costs each year.</p>
<p>Water softeners generally have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are correctly preserved. Making sure the brine tank never runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also secure the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners enhance the regeneration cycle and help eliminate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
