<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the water heater.
