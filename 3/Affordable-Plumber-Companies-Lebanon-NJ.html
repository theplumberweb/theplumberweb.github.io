<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. Due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, typically regrow after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
