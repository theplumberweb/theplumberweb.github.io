<h3>Local Plumbers & Contractors Monroe CT</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job tidying up after it too.</p>
<p>Strainers are recommended prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire fighting water lines. No strainer is to be used in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance coverage Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction. In this post we take a look at plumbers vs. plumbing contractors and specialized plumbers. RPZ backflow systems, on the other hand, have valves that only open when water is flowing forward.</p>
