<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
