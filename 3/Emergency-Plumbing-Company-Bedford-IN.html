It is important that the repair service technician understands the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
