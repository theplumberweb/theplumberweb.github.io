<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you do not get that chance. In addition, your contractor understands the telltale signs of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in studs, floors, and joists. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with an inferior plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the best.</p>
