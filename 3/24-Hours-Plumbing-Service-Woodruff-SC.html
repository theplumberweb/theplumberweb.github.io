<p>You count on your drains to carry wastewater from your tub, sink or shower. Gradually, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These materials gather in the drain and eventually harden versus the pipe walls, making them hard to remove. Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leakages are one of the most common signs that your system is at the end of its lifespan, specifically if they are causing major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is normally made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would usually cause rust. After extended usage, these rods will ultimately end up being worn out and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your water heater very quickly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
