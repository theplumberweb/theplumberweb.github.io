<p>It can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less easily when water is hard. Water softening can avoid these unfavorable impacts. Gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a security precaution, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives gas a smell frequently related to rotten eggs. If it happens, this distinctive aroma enables you to smell a potential leak. Always leave if you believe a leak.</p>
<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, known as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them operating correctly. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality.
