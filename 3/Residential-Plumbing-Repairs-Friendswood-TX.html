<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
