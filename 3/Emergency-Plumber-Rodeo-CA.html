<p>You live in an older house. There's a great possibility that you'll need to have it done quickly if your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to corrode and burst when they get old.

This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>

Some types of pipes can rust in time. This rust will break off into your home's water supply and can turn your tap water a reddish or brown  color.
