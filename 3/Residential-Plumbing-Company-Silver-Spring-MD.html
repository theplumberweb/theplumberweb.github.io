<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Silver Spring MD 20906</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
