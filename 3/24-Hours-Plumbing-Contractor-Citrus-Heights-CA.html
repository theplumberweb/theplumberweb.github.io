<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for setting up backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Defense Systems for performing yearly forward circulation tests are in some cases perceived as a mandate to have them. But the intent of the code is to just attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers are present.</p>
<p>If you have an older house, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This rust can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have many negative effects on your health. Corroded pipes likewise lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>A leak in a single pipe can quickly be fixed by changing that area of harmed piping. Nevertheless, when the problem is discovered in pipes throughout your home, it might be time to think about whole-house repiping. Few house owners are thrilled with the concept of changing all their pipes, however dealing with the job before the plumbing system stops working permits you to prevent substantial residential or commercial property damage.</p>
