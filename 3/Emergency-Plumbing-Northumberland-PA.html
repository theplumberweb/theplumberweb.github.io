<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services Northumberland PA</h3>
<p>These guys were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had great evaluations and a fair price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it also.</p>
<p>Anything that goes down returns up again - This is the 2nd most typical sign that your drains are clogged.
