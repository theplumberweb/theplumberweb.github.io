<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step procedure.

In this way, we can determine the very best course of action to fix your problems.

<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this accreditation.
