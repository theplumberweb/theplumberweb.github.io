All replacements should be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the appropriate kind of assembly based on the conditions on your residential or commercial property (see area below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Moreover, the assembly must satisfy the lead complimentary requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the one month, all water services will be stopped until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
