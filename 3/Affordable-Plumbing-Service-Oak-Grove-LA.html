<p>Many property owners think their utility companies or house owners insurance coverage is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, however the truth is that in most cases you, the homeowner, are accountable. A lot of basic property owners insurance policies and local energy companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems around your house.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
