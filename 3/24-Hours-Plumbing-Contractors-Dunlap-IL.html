<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Water system by the public utility consists of some amounts of hazardous chemicals like arsenic and lead.

The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the whole size of the sewer line and offer a careful cleaning.</p>
