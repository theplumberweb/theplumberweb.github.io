<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Spring Valley NY</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
