<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
