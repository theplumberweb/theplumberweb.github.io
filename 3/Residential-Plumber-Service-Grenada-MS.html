<p>To figure out if your home is a poly house," begin with the outside. Underground water pipe are generally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Frequently, it enters the house near the water heater. Your main turned off is attached to the end of the water main. Ensure you check both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>To make it basic, property owners with testable backflow devices are expected to have them tested by a certified tester every year.
