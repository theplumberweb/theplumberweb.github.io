<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully raise the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed properly (Photo 8). You don't have to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes 2 fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk.
