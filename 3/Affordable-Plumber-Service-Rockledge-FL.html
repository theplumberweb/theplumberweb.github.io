<p>Aside from these two essential elements, there are a myriad of small, maybe less vital things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.
