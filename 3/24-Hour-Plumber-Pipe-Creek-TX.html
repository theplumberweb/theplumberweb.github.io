<p>Tankless Water Heaters - supply hot water on demand without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring warm water triggers the heater and water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases should never be put down the garbage disposal since they can restrain the blades. Finally, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and need to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to guarantee that all food particles have actually been washed through the pipes.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed. Schedule a price quote as soon as possible and ensure nothing is near the heater that could be potentially damaged if it is in a garage and a little sluggish leak. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
