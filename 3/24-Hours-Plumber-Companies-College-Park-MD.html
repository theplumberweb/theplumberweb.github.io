<h2>Tips To Hire Plumbing Contractors in College Park</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may need extra adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this certification. I've contacted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
