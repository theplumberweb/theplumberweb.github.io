<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a brand-new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself.
