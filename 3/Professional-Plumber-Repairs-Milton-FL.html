<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can happen when there is an abrupt reduction in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as during fire fighting or when a water pipe breaks.
