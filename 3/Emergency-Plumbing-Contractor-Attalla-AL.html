<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with house owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are certain pollutants that homeowners are dealing with and an RO can assist relieve those concerns. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste.

<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
