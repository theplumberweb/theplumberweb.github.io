As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close appropriately.
