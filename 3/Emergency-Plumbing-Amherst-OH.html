Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate hardness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
