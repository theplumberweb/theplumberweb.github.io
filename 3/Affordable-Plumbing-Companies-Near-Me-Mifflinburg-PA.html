Corrosion can still happen under conditions that are favorable to the formation of hard-water scale and even when hard-water scale is currently present.</p>
<p>If you see absolutely nothing apparent, place the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the unit, and twist best and left. Examine that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and then try the reset button if the motor spins easily. If these procedures do not work, and your disposer's warranty has ended, it's time to replace it.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line clogs are not something a homeowner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain specialist to use a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to recognize and repair the drain problem. This kind of camera is particularly beneficial in finding a problem if you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system.</p>

Possibilities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger might not suffice to resolve this issue. Call a plumber immediately.</p>
