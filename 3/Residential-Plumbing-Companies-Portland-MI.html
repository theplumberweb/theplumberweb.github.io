<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.

A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
