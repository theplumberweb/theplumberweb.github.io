<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Typical sufficient that many people choose do-it-yourself repairs. But often even determining the leak can be a problem. It might be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, garbage disposal fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>EcoWater's elite water softener system is our conditioner, offered in a single-tank "cabinet" style. It is extremely suggested for either local or well water supplies.
