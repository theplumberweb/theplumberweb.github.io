Perhaps there is a fracture in the sink's basin and you've discovered a little leak.

<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and quickly be disposed of through the sink, this large amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without impeding water circulation. By installing a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by conserving the quantity of trash that gets sent out to garbage dumps and other dumping locations. With a garbage disposal the trash is handled through already existing water facilities.</p>

We recommend natural items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than items including extreme chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
