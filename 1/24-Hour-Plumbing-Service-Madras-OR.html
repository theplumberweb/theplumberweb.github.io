<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced immediately. Before you can request an inspection, you must first acquire the required authorization( s) for the work you mean to do. You can have a look at our Permit page for more details on acquiring an authorization. As soon as you get a license you can begin with the work. However, you must call for inspection before you hide any work or cover.</p>

Without being fixed as rapidly as possible, it might cause a fair bit of damage if the natural gas inside becomes ignited. The first top priority is to turn off the supply of natural gas and call the energy company if an individual understands that they have ruptured a gas line.</p>
