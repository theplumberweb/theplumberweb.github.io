<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that individuals expect to see but hardly ever stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, you may have a farmhouse or apron sink, a bar sink, an undermount sink, or a cast iron sink, perhaps with an enamel plating. Double-basin stainless-steel sinks are a popular and timeless  choice, as are bar sinks, kitchen island sinks, and sinks with drain boards. No matter what kind of sink you need serviced, Candu can help you find a local plumber to fix, install, or replace it.</p>
