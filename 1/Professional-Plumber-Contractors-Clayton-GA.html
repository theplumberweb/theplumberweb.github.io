<p>Garbage disposals also need to have routine use to avoid corrosion. Magnesium and calcium are favorably charged ions. Other favorably charged ions will dissolve less easily in tough water than in water that does not consist of calcium and magnesium because of their presence. Assemblies will not be set up in locations including corrosive, dangerous or hazardous fumes or gases which might render the assembly unusable or present a safety threat to workers.</p>

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
