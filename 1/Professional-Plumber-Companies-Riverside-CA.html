<p>Gently listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you may be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed correctly (Picture 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>That is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. Schedule a price quote as soon as possible and ensure absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be potentially harmed if it is in a garage and a small slow leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
