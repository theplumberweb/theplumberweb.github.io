<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complicated than replacing with a different design. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this might be something to think about. A completely various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink port has to be puttied into place. A safe seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is attached. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, making sure to connect wires properly, and the base covered to secure the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>You need to spend at least $50 to get a high-quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a resilient finish and a reliable stopper system. The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can wear, however screwing it in and out can be bothersome. The twist-and-drop style is much easier to utilize but requires periodic -ring replacement.</p>
