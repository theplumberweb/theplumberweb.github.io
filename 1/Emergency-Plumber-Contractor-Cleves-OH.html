<p>The heating aspect is taking longer to heat the water than it should if the water feels warm. But this particular concern is when you have no hot water streaming in your house.

However, if the hot water heater system has all of these problems happening frequently, then a hot water heater replacement is needed.</p>

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully listen and lift the rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed appropriately (Photo 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>With PVC you have a number of options if your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering an interruption. The other is to go on and replace the entire line. Certainly replace if the line is about 40 years old and is revealing signs of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it may be an appropriate alternative to do just that. Nevertheless, if the offset worsens trenchless may no longer be a choice.</p>
