Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>

<p>Check the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is inexpensive and simple. But finding the best washer might not be. The most typical washers are often readily available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be tough to find. If you decide to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the store to discover a match. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
