<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Pikeville NC 27863</h3>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic items, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work much better than items containing extreme chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is usually made of aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would normally cause rust. After extended use, these rods will eventually end up being broken and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you might experience major problems with your water heater very quickly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>

An example is the piping between a public water system or consumer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
