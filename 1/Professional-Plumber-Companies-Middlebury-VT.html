<p>Many homeowners believe their energy companies or property owners insurance is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the truth is that oftentimes you, the homeowner, are accountable. A lot of basic house owners insurance coverage and local utility companies or towns do not cover repairs to or replacement of the significant systems around your house.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>
