<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
