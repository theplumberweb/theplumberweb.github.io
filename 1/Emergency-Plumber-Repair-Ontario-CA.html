<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Ontario CA</h3>

When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
