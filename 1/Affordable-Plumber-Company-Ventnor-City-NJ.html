<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less critical things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
