<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely critical part of the style of each part. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
