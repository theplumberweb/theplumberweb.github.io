<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is really low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Outdoor plumbing for leakages or blockages. After examining everything inside your home, your pro will then inspect the outdoor plumbing.
