Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
