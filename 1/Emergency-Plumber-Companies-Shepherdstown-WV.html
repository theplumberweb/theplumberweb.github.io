<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to prevent winter freezing. The new pipe, made from a modern, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall material are removed to connect the pipes to the water fixtures, Wood says. Depending upon the scope of work being carried out and the type of building, you may have several inspections.</p>
<p>Frequently brought on by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and check if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is normally the fix. Alternatively, in some cases a defective fill valve may activate intermittently, also. Water will not drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>
