<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible option, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
