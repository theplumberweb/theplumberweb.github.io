<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant costs can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for homeowners. A PE or RA can help determine if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
