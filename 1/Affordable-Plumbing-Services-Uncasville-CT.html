The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends changing to one of the other 2 types of salts if this stain is an inconvenience in your house. As soon as the brand-new salt has actually had a chance to entirely replace the solar salt in your system, then buy some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as advised in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
