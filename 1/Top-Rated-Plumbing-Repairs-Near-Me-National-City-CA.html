<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the best length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might need to make a time-wasting journey to the store.

<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

The end result is an unlimited hot water supply throughout your home, without any decrease in water pressure.</p>
