<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

You'll more than likely notification lower water pressure in the shower or when washing dishes.
