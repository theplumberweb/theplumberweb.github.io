<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Fortuna CA 95540</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
