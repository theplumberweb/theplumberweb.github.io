<p>Depending upon your water quality, some softeners might be able to completely or partly remove copper, iron, manganese, and radium, in addition to calcium and magnesium. If leaves the softener and passes through your house's pipes and plumbing, note that copper can reenter the water after.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
