For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
