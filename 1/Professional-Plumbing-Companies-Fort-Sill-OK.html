<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future.
