<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are seriously damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes 2 four foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for up to 100 years.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
