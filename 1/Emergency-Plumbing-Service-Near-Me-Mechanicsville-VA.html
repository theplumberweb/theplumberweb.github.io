Once it has passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve arrangement developed to prevent the reversal of the circulation of water. The 2 types of pipes that we choose to utilize for repiping are copper and PEX. These are 2 really various products, but they both have unbelievable sturdiness and longevity.</p>
