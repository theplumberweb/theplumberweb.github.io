<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal proof that particular magnetic and electromagnetic devices can be efficient in preventing scale development in tough water systems. It is extremely difficult to judge such claims, which are almost never based on tests that are well adequate described to permit others to assess them and to validate the outcomes. While the lack of "scientific" proof does not in itself revoke a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it needs to make one hesitate to accept it without some guarantee of efficiency.</p>
<p>If you're considering switching to a tankless hot water heater, it's a great concept to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of this innovative option. While tankless water heaters are terrific in numerous respects, they are not ideal for everybody.
