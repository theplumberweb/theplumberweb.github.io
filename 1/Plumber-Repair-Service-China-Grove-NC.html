<p>Is your home 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary product used in plumbing.

<p>Having your plumbing frequently evaluated is an essential part of preventative maintenance. However, lots of property owners and company owner have an out of sight, out of mind" approach to plumbing and do not assess their pipes until there is a pushing problem.

<p>The types of backflow preventers the company offers include check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (consisting of stainless-steel designs), and reduced pressure zone assemblies. Tip: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, remove the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet before mounting the disposal. Likewise attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you attach the P-trap.</p>
<p>There are two broad categories of sources of prospective cross contamination: internal and external. Internal sources consist of the aforementioned kitchen sinks, basins, tanks, toilets, fire control system water, water from ice makers, soapy water from sinks or floor cleaning tasks, and devices such as meal washers, hot water tanks, glowing water heating unit, and so on.
