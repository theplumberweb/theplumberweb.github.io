<p>The cost to replace pipes under the house is merely the cost to install a brand-new plumbing system which can range from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per linear foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per direct foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under homes, often times in concrete. It is rather common to leave the old pipes in location after detaching them. The brand-new pipe is just set up in the path of least resistance.
