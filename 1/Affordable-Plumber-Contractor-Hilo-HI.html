<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide.

If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
