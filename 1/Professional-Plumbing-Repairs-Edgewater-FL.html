<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive product. Tank water heaters are the most typical, and are run with gas. Their design includes an insulated tank where water is heated and stored till required. Natural gas water heaters are more energy efficient and operating costs are decreased by about 50 percent, compared to electrical hot water heater. Storage tank water heaters have a greater preliminary cost than electrical.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Dual Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers offered that you may encounter. The very first is a check valve. The second is a double check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Double Check even though it might be marketed as one! Do not get ripped off! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses comparable to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>
