<p>Aside from these two essential elements, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>

Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with completion left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
