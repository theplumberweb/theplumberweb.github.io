<p>Once the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut down stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be gotten rid of from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
