When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to pass through. Due to the fact that of the tight space, the pipes often make odd gurgling sounds as water efforts to travel through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the strange sounds emanating from your sink.</p>
