<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less vital things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
