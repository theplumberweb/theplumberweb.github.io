<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
