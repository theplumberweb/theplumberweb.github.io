<p>When used in fighting a fire, fire department connections can be an issue. Firefighters by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention problems. They are worrying about safeguarding people's lives and to a lower extent their property. Getting the essential volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will utilize water from any source readily available to attain that goal. This can produce cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome imply that the level of defense on the fire protection system may need to be increased to a high threat security level.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system determines the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regeneration immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
