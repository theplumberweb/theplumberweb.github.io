<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Each component of the assembly must be tested to determine what requires repair. The field test may not always reveal you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the standard rubber repair kit are essential. There may be additional test treatments, beyond those established in the tester certification program, that can supply information revealing the intensity of the failure that might assist in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>
