Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, especially in older communities where clay pipe might have been used.

<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the element, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
