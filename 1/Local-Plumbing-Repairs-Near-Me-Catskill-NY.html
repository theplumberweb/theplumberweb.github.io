<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
