<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>
<p>Rusting and corrosion on the exterior of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can suggest a possible issue with the hot water heater.
