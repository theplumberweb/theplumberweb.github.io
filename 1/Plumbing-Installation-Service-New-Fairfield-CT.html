<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is normally made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can bring in the irons that would normally trigger rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately end up being broken and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you might experience significant problems with your hot water heater very rapidly, not to discuss finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main sewers traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
