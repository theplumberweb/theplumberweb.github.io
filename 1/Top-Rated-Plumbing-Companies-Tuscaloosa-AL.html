<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing detergent from working efficiently since hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to use increasingly more detergent to accomplish the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and disinfected throughout regeneration. Finally, water consisting of the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
