While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's also a problem for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can consume to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration process. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not.

Such designs are hassle-free if you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule.</p>
