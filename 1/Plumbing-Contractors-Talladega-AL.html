<h3>Pressure Vacuum Breakers in Talladega Alabama</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
