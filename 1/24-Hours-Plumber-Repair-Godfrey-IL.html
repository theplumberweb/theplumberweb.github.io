<p>A guideline is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, say, you need a brand-new burner kit and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
