<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is an unexpected reduction in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as during fire fighting or when a water pipe breaks.

Tank water heaters are frequently discovered in many homes. Their parts are an insulated tank, typically holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water up until it's required. A pipe emerges from the leading to deliver hot water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
