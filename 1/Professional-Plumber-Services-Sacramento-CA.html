<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a necessity more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
