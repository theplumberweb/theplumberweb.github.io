<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
