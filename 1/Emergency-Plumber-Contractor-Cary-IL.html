<p>Hot water heater diagnostics: We determine what is incorrect with your water heater, as well as what maintenance work requires to be carried out moving on. Water softeners usually utilize salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are supplied from liquified salt chloride salt, also called brine. In the ion exchange process, salt ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that look like wet sand.</p>
