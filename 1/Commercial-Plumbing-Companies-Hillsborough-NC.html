<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, usually regenerate after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such models are hassle-free.</p>
