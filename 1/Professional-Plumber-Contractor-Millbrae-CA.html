<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a feasible option, specifically when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and family.</p>
