<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our houses, for lightening our stoves, and for running home appliances such as water heaters.

As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer. However, to thwart off that threat, mercaptans are added into gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Make sure to just rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
