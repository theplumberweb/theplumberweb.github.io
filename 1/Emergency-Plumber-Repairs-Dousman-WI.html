The unit selected for an offered installation must be proper for the system design and site conditions, consisting of factor to consider of whether back siphoning or backpressure is likely to occur. Further, it needs to be installed in accordance with plumbing codes, maker requirements, and engineering guidelines for the type of system to be used.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.
