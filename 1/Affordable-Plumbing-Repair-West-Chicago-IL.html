<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, snake or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
