<h3>Residential 24 Hour Emergency Plumber Near Me Lawrence KS</h3>
<p>A backflow preventer stops water inside your pipes from receding to the City system if pressure is lost. Backflow can pollute the water supply. The fundamental mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. All leaks, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be fixed.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or particles in the water line avoids them from closing entirely, backflow can happen.</p>
