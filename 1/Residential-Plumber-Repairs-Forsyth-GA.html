<p>There's a good possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This corrosion can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable impacts on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>There are health and safety risks one should avoid while dealing with a sewer line project. Methane gas, salmonella, e. coli, giardia - all are discovered in sewer pipes and might expose workers throughout the sewer repair procedure. If your Do It Yourself dig hits a gas line, breathing the gas can damage your body, and there is a risk of fire or explosion damage to your home or your next-door neighbor's. Another danger in sewer repair tasks is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig site. Your safety and health are too important to risk in a DIY sewer task! Prevent these security hazards by employing a professional plumber.</p>
