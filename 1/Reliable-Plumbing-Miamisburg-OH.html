Water pressure may fail or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
