Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
