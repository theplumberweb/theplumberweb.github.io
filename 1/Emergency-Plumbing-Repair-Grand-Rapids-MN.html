<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing set up throughout building of a new or renovated structure is installed by knowledgeable craftsmen in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the meals, or pour flat soda in your sink, you usually know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.

Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly.
