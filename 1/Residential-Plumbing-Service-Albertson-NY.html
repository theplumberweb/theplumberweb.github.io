This opts for every other turned off valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to a good start if everything is working appropriately.</p>

<p>If your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing an interruption, with PVC you have a couple of choices. The other is to go on and replace the entire line. If the line is about 40 years old and is showing indications of age throughout, certainly replace. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench.
