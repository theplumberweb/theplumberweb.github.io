The maintaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Photo 1). Then get rid of the old manage and lever, slide the brand-new handle into place, and thread on the retaining nut. Tighten up by relying on the right (Picture 2).</p>
