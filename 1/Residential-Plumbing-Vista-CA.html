<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
