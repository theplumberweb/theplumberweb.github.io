<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Many softeners have actually a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to provide some type of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to preserve the unit.</p>
