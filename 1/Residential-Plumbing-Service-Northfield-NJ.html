<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Northfield NJ 08225</h3>
<p>If you've always resided in an area with difficult water, you might not realize how much it impacts you-- however if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too familiar with the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from tough water. Tough water disrupts the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, triggering you to use more. Hard water likewise makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red typically.</p>
