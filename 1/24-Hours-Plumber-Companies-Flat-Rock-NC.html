<h3>Blocked Sewer in Flat Rock North Carolina</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
