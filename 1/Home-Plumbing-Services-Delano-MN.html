<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components may have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the part, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
