<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines.

Property owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers are a reasonably easy system, in spite of their importance. Most of commercial use backflow prevention setups utilize a valve system that gets in touch with the irrigation line within your organisation, where watering fulfills the main water system.
