The field test might not always reveal you the severity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the standard rubber repair kit are required.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially planned for the disposer discharge elbow.

Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
