<p>After the pipe is cleaned, we move to utilize our repairs as rapidly and efficiently as possible. Our devices is trenchless-based, and the liner we place into the sewer line is able to pump up in order to use the epoxy resin.

Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
