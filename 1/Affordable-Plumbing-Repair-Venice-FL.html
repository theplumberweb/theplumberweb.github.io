<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the defective pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.

<h3>Sewer Line Repair in Venice Florida</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube most likely will not be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation.

To prevent this, make sure the new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one independently at the same time for about $3.</p>

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
