It is very important that the repair technician understands the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade.

<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand run valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
