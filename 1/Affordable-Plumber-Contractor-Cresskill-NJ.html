When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully lift the rod and listen. If the water shuts down, you might have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted correctly (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>If your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing a stoppage, with PVC you have a couple of choices. The other is to go on and replace the whole line. Definitely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing indications of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it might be an appropriate alternative to do just that. Nevertheless, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be an alternative.</p>
