Local plumber estimated rate of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ delighted I checked around. Under the sink, place a container or pan below the drain, then utilize locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain.
