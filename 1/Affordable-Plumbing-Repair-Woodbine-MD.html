<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not actually the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes.

Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
