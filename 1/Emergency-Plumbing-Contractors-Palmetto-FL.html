<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
<p>Sewer problems are the last thing homeowner wish to get their hands unclean with. It requires more than simply elbow grease to fix broken sewer systems, and the trouble is often due to how frustrating it is to assess the damage. This is much more problematic if the damage is irreversible or requires more comprehensive repair, particularly in commercial settings.</p>
