<p>I can't state enough good ideas about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had a really short amount of time due to closing on a house sale. Each and every single individual I encountered from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work team. Friendly, interacted well, absolutely responsive and truly cared to assist me through this very difficult job. All of the people I came across were good example for what a well run service organisation must be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're excellent.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (generally 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
