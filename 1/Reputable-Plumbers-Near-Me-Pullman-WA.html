<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>

<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Research study compared detergent dose, water firmness, and washing temperature level to see if hardness had an effect on cleaning agent cost savings. The research study included tests that eliminated hard soils, in addition to examining identifying and filming. Researchers found that softened water uses practically 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans up as well as water at 10 gpg hardness level. That detergent savings increases to almost 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>

<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
