<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>There can be a range of reasons you house or service is experiencing sewer problems. If your toilets are flushing gradually, you're experiencing constant sewer backups, or notice an odd or foul  smell is coming from your drains, it might be an indication that it is time to call experts to completely examine your drains and fix your sewer problems.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in areas where the ambient temperature is maintained at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water flows instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In circumstances where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little packing dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high risk protection assembly.</p>
