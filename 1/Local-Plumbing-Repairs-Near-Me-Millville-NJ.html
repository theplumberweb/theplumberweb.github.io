<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

You may be thinking that it doesn't make good sense to use a pipe that responds with water as your home's main source of water transport, and you would be right. Nevertheless, when most of these pipes were being installed, nobody knew this was going to be the result. Thankfully, there are a lot of other piping options nowadays consisting of copper.</p>

This normally just takes a couple of hours, however if there are unexpected circumstances, your company might need to return the following day.</p>
