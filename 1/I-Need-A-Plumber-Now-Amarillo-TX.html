<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Amarillo TX</h3>
<p>The most effective way to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>This is incredibly essential! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system. Existing regulations restrict the quantity of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines. We offer 2 types of water treatment systems for hard water: Benefit Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
