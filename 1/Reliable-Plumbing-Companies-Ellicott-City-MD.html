<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer system calculates the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regeneration normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>That is an indicator the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank.
