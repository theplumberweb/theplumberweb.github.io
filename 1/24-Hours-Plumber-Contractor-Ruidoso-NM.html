<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately begins. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regrowth typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>A number of companies, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) offer accreditation courses created to train specialists to evaluate backflow preventers. Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to become certified.</p>
