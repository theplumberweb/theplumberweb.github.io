<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
