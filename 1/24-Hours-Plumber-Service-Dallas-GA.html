Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
