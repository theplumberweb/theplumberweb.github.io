Also connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you connect the P-trap.</p>

The most typical washers are often available at home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be tough to discover. If you decide to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>

You can do a little online research so you can make final modifications before inspection day if you're getting a rough-in or last inspection on a building job or remodel. Stopping working a checkup can indicate unpleasant hold-ups in your project.</p>
