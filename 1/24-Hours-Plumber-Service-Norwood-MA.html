<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>When the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may happen. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively secured, safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be pushed into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to present a chemical compound that serves as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than building up on surfaces. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a water heater, the accumulation could still take place.</p>
