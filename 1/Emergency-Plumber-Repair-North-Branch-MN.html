<p>Depending upon your situation, your plumber might use one or a mix of piping product during your house repiping project.

PEX or polyethylene pipes have the benefit of versatility, which implies plumbers can flex the pipes removing the need for joints, which conserves money and time and reduces the danger of joint leakages. PEX also resists deterioration and freezing better than metal pipes. Your residential plumbing company will decide which product is best depending on your requirements.</p>
