<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a feasible solution, especially when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids.
