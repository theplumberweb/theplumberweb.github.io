<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a practical option, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
