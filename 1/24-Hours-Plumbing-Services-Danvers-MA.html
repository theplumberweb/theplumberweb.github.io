<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
