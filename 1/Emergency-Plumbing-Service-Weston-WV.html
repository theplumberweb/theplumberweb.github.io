<p>In this situation, dirty water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You likewise need to purchase a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon flow, odor, color or taste. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other problems in your house's plumbing system. More complex concerns with water temperature level or pressure may require changing the hot water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capability and type.</p>
