<p>The average plumber's per hour wage is $68-$ 138. Often times basic repairs, such as unclogging a drain or a toilet, will have a fixed price of about $220 unless there are extenuating scenarios. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a cost to take a look at your situation and tell you what requires to be done, however if you hire them, that charge will be deducted from the expense. A plumber may charge $50-$ 100 to detect the issue and come. 2 Having to call a plumber after hours, on the weekend, or on a holiday will cost more.</p>
<p>That is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank. Schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that could be potentially harmed if it is in a garage and a little sluggish leak. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
