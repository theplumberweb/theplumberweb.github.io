<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and intricate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping.

Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and eliminates from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
