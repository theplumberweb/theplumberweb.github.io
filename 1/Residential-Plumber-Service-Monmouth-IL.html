Some house owners will attempt to dislodge the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These solutions do work, particularly if you are handling a little drain clog. However, they are usually short-lived fixes that do not offer irreversible resolutions.</p>
