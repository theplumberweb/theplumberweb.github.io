<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Burlington MA 01803</h3>
<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced right away. Before you can ask for an inspection, you must first obtain the required permit( s) for the work you plan to do. You can take a look at our License page for more details on obtaining an authorization. Once you get a permit you can commence with the work. However, you should call for inspection before you cover or conceal any work.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are significantly damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root invasion for as much as 100 years.</p>
