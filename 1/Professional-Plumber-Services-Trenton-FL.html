<p>The Plumbing Bureau's main focus is on security within a structure. Plumbing inspections guarantee that water systems in buildings are connected appropriately, without any cross-connection to pollute potable water systems.

Warm water heaters are also examined to ensure that they have actually been set up effectively, to avoid a surge.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
