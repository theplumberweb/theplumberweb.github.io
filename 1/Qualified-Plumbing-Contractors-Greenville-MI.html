Property owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Rusting and corrosion on the outside of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a prospective issue with the hot water heater.
