Property owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Rusting and corrosion on the outside of the water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a prospective issue with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also mean the water heater is near the end of its life.
