<p>The most efficient way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

Without storm drains we 'd need to deal with flooded locations regularly during bouts of severe rain. If the cost to repair your water tank is 50% or more than the cost of a brand-new one, getting a brand-new one is more affordable.</p>
