When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to travel through. The pipes frequently make odd gurgling sounds as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe since of the tight area. This triggers the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are available, resulting in the odd sounds emanating from your sink.</p>
