Inspecting the water meter is a fantastic next action in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and check. There is a leak somewhere and this could be severe issue if it is. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in your house ought to have water.
