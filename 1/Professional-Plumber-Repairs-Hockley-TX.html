Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
