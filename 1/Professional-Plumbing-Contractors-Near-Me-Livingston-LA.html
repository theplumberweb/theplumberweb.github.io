<p>Homeowners typically ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-efficient. The answer depends upon your home.

Electric ranges are also easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
