<p>Gas leaks are typically discovered at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that enables connections and disconnections of gas devices.

You likely have a gas leak and must right away call a gas plumber to perform an emergency gas line repair if it bubbles.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are significantly damaged, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
