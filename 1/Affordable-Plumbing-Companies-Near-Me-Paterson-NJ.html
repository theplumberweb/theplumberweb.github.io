<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers enhances water's taste, however its high price makes it not practical as a household service. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothing, and, in some cases, contain phosphates that damage the environment.

<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron.

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high hazard protection assembly.</p>
