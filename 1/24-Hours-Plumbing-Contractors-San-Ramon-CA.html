<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of circulation of water which might bring unclean water or other, dangerous substances into the general public water supply and private plumbing. Backflow can happen in a number of situations that may draw water from locations such as garden water fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines.

One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
