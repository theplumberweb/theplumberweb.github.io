<p>I can't state enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had an extremely brief amount of time due to closing on a home sale. Every person I encountered from Marquita doing logistics for my job to every member of the work team. Friendly, communicated well, absolutely responsive and truly cared to help me through this very difficult task.

<p>Installation and replacement costs are typically comparable, though replacement typically will not need surcharges, such as application fees. New meters need to meet policies and code requirements for their placement, and gas suppliers may need a special meter for their services, limiting your choices. Layout - Once you add a 2nd floor and even third floor, pipes need to be added to it. This is more intricate than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor extensive. Plumbing services will use more materials which contributes to your labor costs.</p>
<p>While pipe lining is a fantastic option for most people, there are some situations where repiping is the only option.
