The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Frequently, it enters the home near the water heater. Your main shut off is attached to completion of the water pipe. Ensure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
