<p>Do not put everything down your waste disposal unit. It's important to enjoy what you put down your waste disposal unit.

Fruit and vegetable peels can also trigger obstructions and jams - consider composting or putting these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can collect and harden in your drain also.
