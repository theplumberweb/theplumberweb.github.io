<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Saint Johnsbury VT</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the problem.
