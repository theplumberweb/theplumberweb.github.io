<h3>Bathtub Faucet Replacement in Hazleton Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Property owners often ask if a gas hot water heater or an electric system is more cost-effective. The answer depends upon your home. While gas designs are more economical to run, they do need an existing natural gas line. The cost of an electrical water heater is generally lower, but it can be more expensive to run. Electric varieties are also simpler to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
