<p>As a locally-owned business, integrity and duty are extremely important to developing a reputation for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable water system within a structure these gadgets are known as seclusion" BFP. Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no chance to provide one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>

<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity.

Anything you pour down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
