<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair split pipes without needing to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Day to day usage should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also occur if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the system in a safe and steady  place.

You must wait up until after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regrowth. You must also check to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
