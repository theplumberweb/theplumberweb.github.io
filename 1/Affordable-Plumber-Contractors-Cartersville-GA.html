<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water system line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the main water system system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
