<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for most building and construction contractors (or their workers). The secret to the innovation is being able to manage both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby removing hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
