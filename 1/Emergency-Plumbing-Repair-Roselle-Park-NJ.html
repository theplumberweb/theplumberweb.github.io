<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
