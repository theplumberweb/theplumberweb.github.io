<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

It's a good concept to do a little research study into the world of plumbing before you call someone and turn them loose on your plumbing system. A good plumber can save your bacon. A bad plumber can be your worst headache in regards to issues that keep returning to bite you.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit lasts an average of 10 to 12 years. This typical life-span calculation assumes typical wear and tear of the system.
