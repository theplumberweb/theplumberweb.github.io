<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation of water which might carry dirty water or other, dangerous compounds into the general public water system and personal plumbing. Backflow can take place in a variety of circumstances that might draw water from places such as garden fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines. Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>

This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
