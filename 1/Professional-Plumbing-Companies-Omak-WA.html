<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the general public water system and personal on-site supply of water and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections in between potable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention methods. Secondary backflow techniques provide an increased level of protection for the public water supply system.</p>

Not only was he incredibly professional and comprehensive however he was able to answer all my concerns worrying the service. If I could, I would offer 6 stars. A camera inspection of your sewer line is among the most efficient methods of finding the exact location of a plumbing problem.

<p>Think of all the locations water flows in and out of your home. These are the areas that a professional evaluation must cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other devices. Even your water lines must be covered. While your hot water heater and toilets will receive unique attention, an experienced plumber wants to analyze the complete health of your system. That suggests testing for correct water pressure. After all, too much pressure can harm your plumbing, and too little can leave your home with inefficient water home appliances.</p>
