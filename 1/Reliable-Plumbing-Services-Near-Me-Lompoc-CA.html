<p>Numerous property owners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their dirty or clogged drain issues. These chemicals are simple to utilize and affordable, however they damage your pipes and their impacts are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize harsh chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe developing vulnerable points that are susceptible to burst.

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
