Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Colored water-- If your warm water appears rusty, this might be an indicator that your hot water heater is rusting on the inside and may start leaking soon. You can look at this by filling a number of five-gallon pails with your water. Compare If your cold water is clear and your hot water is a brownish color, you most likely need a water heater replacement.</p>
