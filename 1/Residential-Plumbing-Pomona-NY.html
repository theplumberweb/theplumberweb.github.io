<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Pomona NY 10970?</h3>
<p>Water temperature level concerns can be fixed by adjusting the temperature on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be caused by a blocked aerator screen.

Water pressure can also be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>
<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can take place over time from the buildup of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that collects within pipes.
