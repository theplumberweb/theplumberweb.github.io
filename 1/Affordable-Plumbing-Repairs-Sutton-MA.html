<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
