<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily use should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and steady  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you need to wait till after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings.
