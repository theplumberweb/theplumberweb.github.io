It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had great evaluations and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it too.</p>
