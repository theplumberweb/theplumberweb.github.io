<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I have actually talked to a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
<h3>Clogged Bathtub Drain in Thompsons Station Tennessee</h2>
<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
