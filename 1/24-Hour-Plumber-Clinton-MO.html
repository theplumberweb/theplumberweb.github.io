The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth).
