<p>The majority of vehicles have a metal line that runs the length of the vehicle with rubber fuel lines linking at either end, one at the fuel tank and the other to the engine. Repairing a leaking fuel line is a basic task for a repair center and costs in between $60 and $120. Lavacot says it can quickly be done at home by the semi-advanced mechanic. When water is warmed, tough water causes white or gray deposits. Water softening can be utilized to reduce these signs.</p>
