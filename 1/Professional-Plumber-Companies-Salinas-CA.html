<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
