<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>This is very crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to press the waste out of your drain system. Existing guidelines restrict the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines.
