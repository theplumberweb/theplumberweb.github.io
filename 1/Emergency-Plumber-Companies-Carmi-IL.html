<p>Lots of homeowners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their filthy or clogged drain concerns. These chemicals are easy to utilize and inexpensive, however they harm your pipes and their impacts are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use harsh chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe producing weak points that are prone to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a viable solution, especially when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>
