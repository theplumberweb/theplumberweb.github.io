<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and changing them with salt ions.

Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently get rid of solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
