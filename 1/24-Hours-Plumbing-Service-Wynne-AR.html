<p>On and off does any structural damage take place as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is usually spotted prior to it triggers any significant damage. The water leak is usually the size of a pinhole. This small hole permits water to continuously leak out extremely gradually. In time it can result in a substantial build of water. Leaked water usually stays under the house and saturates into the ground soil. This can possibly trigger a cavity if your home's structure was not appropriately compressed.
