<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair professional understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
