As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there must be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you should most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>

<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our houses, for lightening our ranges, and for running home appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas.
