<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing installed during construction of a new or renovated structure is installed by educated craftsmen in accordance with appropriate codes.

When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you typically know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining fixture itself. Obstructions in a component can cause damaging damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
