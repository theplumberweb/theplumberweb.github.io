<p>Before the repair technician begins the repair procedure, he should make certain he has actually evaluated the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to identify any restrictive conditions. If the area is considered a confined area, appropriate safety preventative measures should be followed for correct entry. A appropriate and safe  workplace might entail the positioning of safety barriers or entry constraints around the workspace so the repair professional or the general public around your workspace are not harmed. If the backflow preventer is installed in a limiting area, this might affect the technician's capability to successfully complete the repair.</p>
