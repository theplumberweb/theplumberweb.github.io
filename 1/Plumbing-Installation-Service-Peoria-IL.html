<p>You live in an older home. There's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to wear away and burst when they get old.
