If your kit only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.

<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets must definitely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet should be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural integrity of the house.</p>
