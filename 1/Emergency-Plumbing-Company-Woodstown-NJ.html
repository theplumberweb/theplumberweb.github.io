<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>In regards to the equipment that will be checked, there are two possible choices: a lowered pressure principle device or double check valves. Both consist of a mechanical backflow preventer - essentially, a physical barrier to the backflow. They were fantastic at fixing the clogged drain, but really really careless about repairing the chip in the sink and the use of puddy under the sink.</p>
