Apollo Plumbing Service provides the most professional drain cleaning and maintenance services throughout Oregon and Washington. Whether it's from the buildup of grease or particles, our service technicians can clear the most difficult drain or clog. With frequent cleanings performed throughout the year, our experts can keep clog developments to a minimum while keeping your pipes running smoothly.</p>
