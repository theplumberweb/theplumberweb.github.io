<p>To figure out if your house is a poly home," start with the outside. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it goes into the house near the water heater. Your main shut down is connected to the end of the water pipe. Make certain you check both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe gets in the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
