<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a practical service, especially when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
