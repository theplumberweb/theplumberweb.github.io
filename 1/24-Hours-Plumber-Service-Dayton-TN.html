<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the culprit. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause difficulty too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Typically, the cost to replace a toilet varies in between $ 122 and $228, with most property owners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the rate of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with extra functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, add $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
