<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding.

When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
