<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water travelling through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair service technician understands the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
