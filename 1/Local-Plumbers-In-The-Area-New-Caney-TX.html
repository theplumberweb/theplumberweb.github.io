<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
