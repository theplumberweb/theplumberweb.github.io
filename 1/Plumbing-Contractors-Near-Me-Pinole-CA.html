<p>Changing your sink is a detailed procedure. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
