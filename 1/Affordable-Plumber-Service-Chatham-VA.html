<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
