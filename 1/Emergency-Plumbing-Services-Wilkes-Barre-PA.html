<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might need extra adapters, versatile tubing is far much easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>

<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy.

The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
