<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to detect.</p>

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
