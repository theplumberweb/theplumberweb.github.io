<p>When the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be gotten rid of from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>

When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little loading dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high threat protection assembly.</p>
