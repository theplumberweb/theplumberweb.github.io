<p>When per year to clean out the drains and keep everything running efficiently, we suggest that property owners invest in cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least. It's also advantageous since, at the very same time, the plumber can anticipate the drains and suggest any drain repair, or drain cleaning company. In some cases whatever is clogging the drain will not budge. It may be time to call a professional plumber if you've tried to unclog a bathroom or kitchen sink with no luck. They can figure out the area of the blockage and the best ways to unclog the traffic jam without harming your plumbing.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
