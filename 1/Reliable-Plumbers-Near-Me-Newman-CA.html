<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible amount, there should be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you must most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
