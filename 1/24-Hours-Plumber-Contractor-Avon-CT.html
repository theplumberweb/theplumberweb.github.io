If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.

Though it may need additional adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
