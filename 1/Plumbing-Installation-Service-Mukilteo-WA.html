<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
<p>Water solidity is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Because soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue, the factor you can feel the difference on your skin is. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. Which's where the term hardness" originated from ... it's tough to clean in.</p>
