It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
