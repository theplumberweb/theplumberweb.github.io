Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled.
