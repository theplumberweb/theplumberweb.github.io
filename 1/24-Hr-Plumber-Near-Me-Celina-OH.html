<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and costly plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and area of the pipe, it was a hard task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
