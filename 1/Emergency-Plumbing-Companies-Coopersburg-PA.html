<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to overstated marketing and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening just removes hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual preference not requirement. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this decision a significant one.</p>

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water system line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the main water system system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
