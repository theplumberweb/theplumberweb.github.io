<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal proof that certain magnetic and electromagnetic gadgets can be effective in preventing scale formation in tough water systems.
