<p>I can't say enough advantages about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had an extremely short quantity of time due to closing on a house sale. Every individual I encountered from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work crew.

All of individuals I came across were role models for what a well run service company need to be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're excellent.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
