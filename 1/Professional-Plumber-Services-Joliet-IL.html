<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a viable solution, especially when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your home and family.</p>
