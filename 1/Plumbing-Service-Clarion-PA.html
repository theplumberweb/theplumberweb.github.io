<p>Because it can spread contaminated water back through a circulation system, Backflow is a potential problem in a water system. For example, backflow at unchecked cross connections (cross-connections are any prospective or real connection between the public water system and a source of contamination or pollution) can enable impurities or toxins to enter the potable water supply. Illness can result from ingesting water that has been infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Sewer system cleaning, inspection, investigation and repair are carried out year-round.
