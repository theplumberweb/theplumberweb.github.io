<p>Keep in mind that repiping a home is a significant plumbing repair, and you must just employ a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the task is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses range from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs catch wetness so that it doesn't get in the control unit. Although small pieces of sediment might make it through a drip leg.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
