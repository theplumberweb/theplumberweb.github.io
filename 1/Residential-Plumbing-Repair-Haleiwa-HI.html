<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
