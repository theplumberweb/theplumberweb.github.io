<p>A continuous-feed waste disposal unit is the most typical type which continues to run as long as the power switch is on. A continuous-feed disposal is best for combating big amounts of food waste. Most garbage disposals are plug-in, as it is much safer to have a vibrating unit come unplugged then disconnected from stationary electrical wiring.
