Our repair procedures depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws triggered by waste accumulation can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls appropriately. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits an extensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and offer a mindful cleaning.</p>
