For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak.
