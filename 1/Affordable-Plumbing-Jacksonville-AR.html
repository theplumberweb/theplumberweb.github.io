<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
