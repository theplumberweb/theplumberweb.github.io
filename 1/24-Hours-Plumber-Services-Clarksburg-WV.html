<p>You are responsible for fixing or replacing the assembly within 30 days if your assembly stops working the yearly test. All replacements must be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the proper kind of assembly based on the conditions on your residential or commercial property (see section listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Additionally, the assembly needs to meet the lead complimentary requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the one month, all water services will be ceased up until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of circulation in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can only stream in one instructions. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will constantly flow towards the point of lowest pressure.
