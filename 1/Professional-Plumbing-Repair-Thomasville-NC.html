<p>Our plumber groups aim to keep your house and work places efficient, functional and comfortable. When it rains, any excess water is supposed to decrease a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
