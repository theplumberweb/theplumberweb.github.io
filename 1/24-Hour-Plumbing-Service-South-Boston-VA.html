<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Sewer lines can stop working for a variety of factors, including bad soil conditions, clogs from grease and gunk, and corrosion. Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, particularly in older neighborhoods where clay pipe may have been used. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as compounded if pipes have been enabled to freeze.</p>
<p>Each component of the assembly should be checked to identify what requires repair. The field test may not always reveal you the intensity of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the basic rubber repair set are necessary.
