<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the product. To preserve your health, home, and safety comfort, we utilize just the very best piping: polyethylene. Lots of homes and services use galvanized pipes for water circulation, which tend to deteriorate and can negatively affect our health.

At this point the water is stated to be hard.</p>
<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running home appliances such as hot water heater.

As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer.
