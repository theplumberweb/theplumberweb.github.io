<p>We have an inspection program to recognize water sources and situations that require backflow prevention devices. For residential property, it is very important for owners to signal the District if any changes are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial home, the District evaluates using each brand-new renter. If the current backflow is not up to District code, the correction needs to be made prior to water service is allowed. Cost for the device is covered by either the occupant or the residential or commercial property owner.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a personal water system goes beyond the pressure in the public water circulation lines that can trigger regular flow to reverse, backpressure happens. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a greater floor might trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains need to be carried out on all drains, including toilet, floor, tub and sink drains.</p>
