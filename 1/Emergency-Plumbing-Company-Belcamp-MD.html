The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is devoid of solidity ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
