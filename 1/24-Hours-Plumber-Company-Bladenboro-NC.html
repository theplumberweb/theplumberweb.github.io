<p>Need to clear a clogged drain? Not sure why your hot water heater is leaking? We have the solutions you are trying to find! Call your reliable Kent, WA plumbers at Fox Plumbing & Heating for quick, quality service. Our concern is you, and we aim to keep your house safe and comfortable. If you have difficult water, a water softener is the solution to spotty dishes, dry skin and limescale accumulation in pipes and devices. Here's how simply one system can dramatically improve your water.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow.

<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
